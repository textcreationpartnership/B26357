            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Christian Reader, both Ministers and People.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>F you that are <hi>Ministers</hi> I humbly crave three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Your Pardon for this my audacious undertaking; it is a work best befitting the Protestors themselves, or some other able Divine, who is a man of greater parts and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, better versed in Controversies new and old, than I am, or pretend to be. In the Church there be two ranks of Teachers; some whose work it is <hi>dolare lapides;</hi> others, <hi>ipsos artifices;</hi> our people are like <hi>rough stones</hi> digged out of the Quarre; By the <hi>hammer</hi> of Gods <hi>Word,</hi> many of them, are by his Blessing upon our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, made <hi>polished stones</hi> for Gods <hi>Temple:</hi> But we our selves need polishing by the skill and learning of the others; for they <hi>digg deep</hi> to <hi>search out hidden Knowledge,</hi> they <hi>hunt</hi> and <hi>catch</hi> the <hi>Venison,</hi> which we so readily <hi>dresse,</hi> and dish out to our Hearers; Let them have the honour of their Gifts and Labours. It is the work of an Age to breed a sound learned man, and none but <hi>dunghill</hi>-spirits will undervalue such <hi>precious Jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, If any take himself causelesly charged with Error, I beseech him not to impute that unto me; for I neither choose my Adversary, nor my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but take up both as drawn up by the testimony
<pb facs="tcp:205094:3"/>of faithfull Ministers: And although it be no faire dealing to take up an ill report of another, and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver my manner to take upon trust what I believe, or propose to others to be believed; yet thus far I hope I may be excused, because every one's Error, which I tax by name, or by some characterizing circumstance, I do it upon my owne certain knowledge, that it is their opinion by the testimony of their own writings: As for the rest, I name none, I asperse none, I charge none; onely this I do, known vulgar Errors I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to confute; And this I may do, without asking who is the Father, and without wronging the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Author of them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Seeing it hath pleased God, when I came to the end of the 11. Chapter, to put a period to my Studies by the great encrease of my Disease upon me, and shortly after to my Life it self; my humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest unto some of my Brethren of the Clergy, is, that if it be not too mean a condescention, they will be pleased to go on where I have left, and so to finish the work, unlesse they judge it fitter to draw all anew with their own more learned pensill. The Work is likely to be profitable to the People of this Nation, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in such a time as this.</p>
            <p>You that are the <hi>People,</hi> I crave leave, first, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monish, secondly, to exhort.</p>
            <p>First,<note place="margin">Iude v. 19. 2 Iohn v. 9, 10. Rom. 16.17.</note> Let no man beguile you with faire words, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the gilded notion of <hi>Saints:</hi> Accept no mans face against the least truth of <hi>Jesus.</hi> If any come unto you in <hi>great humilty,</hi> and <hi>shews of love,</hi> in <hi>sheeps cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> and bring <hi>new</hi> and <hi>strange Doctrines;</hi> if he go about to cause <hi>Divisions;</hi> if he be one that forsakes <hi>Ordinances,</hi> vilifies <hi>Ministers,</hi> and the old way of holy
<pb facs="tcp:205094:3"/>walking with God; you are bound in conscience <hi>not to receive him into your houses,</hi> but to avoid him; you sin if you do not.</p>
            <p>Against such corruptours of pure Doctrine, <hi>Ignatius Martyr</hi> in his Epistle <hi>ad Trallianos,</hi> p. 68. doth most gravely warn all Christians in these words.</p>
            <q rend="indent">
               <p>
                  <hi>Sunt quidam vaniloqui, &amp; mentis seductores, non Christiani, sed Christum mercantes, &amp; caupo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantes verbum Evangelii, qui venenum Erroris commiscentes dulci blandimento, sicut oenomeli, ut qui biberit illius potus gustabilem sensum, dulcedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne captus, inobservantèr morti addicatur.</hi>

                  </gap>ze of Christ and his Gospel, who mingle the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their Errours with sweet and pleasing words, as Vintners that mingle Honey with their Wine, so that he which drinketh of that plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant Cup, being delighted with the Taste, is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares mortally poysoned. Thus that holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr who lived in St. <hi>Iohn</hi>'s time.</p>
            </q>
            <p>It is an unworthy temporizing, and a soul destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flattering speech of one that saith, <q>Heresie in a good man is no sin, and Heresie, though the matter be never so grosse, if it be not affected, if there be no design of the will in it, is no sin.</q> But you Beloved, remember what the Scripture saith of Heresie,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.1.</note>
               <hi>There shall be false teachers among you, which shall privily bring in damnable Heresies;</hi> Heresies be damnable, though privily and unawares brought in: Another A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle tells you,<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.11, 12.</note> that <hi>it is a fearfull judgement to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie;</hi> and Heresie is a lie; And if it be so dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, not to believe necessary Truths, what is it to
<pb facs="tcp:205094:4"/>hold that which is most opposite to Truth, grosse He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies? Lastly, observe what a third Apostle saith, 2 Ep. <hi>Iohn</hi> v. 9, 10. <hi>Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God; he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth in the doctrine of Christ, hath both the Father and the Son.</hi> The testimony of three Apostles I hope will stablish you hearts against the glossing and power of all Seducers, and not suffer you to think or speak favourably of the least Corruptions of Christs blessed Gospel; it is matter of <hi>jealousie</hi> to him. Read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2, 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I exhort, that you carefully observe the method and scope of this Book, which is to lay before you certain <hi>distinctions</hi> upon the most materiall, yet perverted points of Religion in these daies, that so the <hi>Chaff</hi> being sorted from the <hi>Wheat,</hi> you may see in which side of the distinction the <hi>Truth</hi> lies, and in which the <hi>Fallacie.</hi> All things are set down as perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuously as the nature of the matter will permit; yet some things you must read over twice or thrice, else you will not <hi>discern</hi> of things that <hi>differ.</hi> It is chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intended for your Edification and Confirmation.

            <head>Some <hi>MEMORIALLS</hi> of this godly, able, profitable Minister of Christ, <hi>William Lyford,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole of what was delivered concerning him after his Funerall Sermon, <hi>by W. H. D. D.</hi>
            </head>
            <head type="sub">Together with <hi>Two remarkable clauses taken out of his last</hi> Will <hi>and</hi> Testament.</head>
            <p>ANd it was the same staffe of comfort, namely, <hi>The look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> which did uphold our dear deceased friend and Brother, whose Funerall we are now to solemnize, in the long time of his sicknesse; and in what ever former trialls, the Lord was pleased to exercise him with: He still had an eye to <hi>that blessed hope,</hi> which he did so firmly believe, was laid up for him. They be materiall pithy expressions of his own, to this purpose, which I think fit to acquaint you with, out of two or three of the last Christian Letters I received from him. In one of them he doth thus expresse himself: <hi>However it shall please God to dispose of my health, I rest comfortably assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of his everlasting love to me in his Son Christ Jesus; who loved me, and gave himself for me.</hi> In another thus, <hi>In the use of the means I doe wait, what the Lord will doe with me; I know it shall be well with me at the last, having so many pledges of his everlasting love to support me.</hi> In a third he hath these words, <hi>My wasting continues, and my stomach also faileth me, but my God faileth me not: in him I have refreshings, in the consideration and experience of the great things, he hath done for me here, and in the contemplation of farre greater things, yet prepared for me.</hi> Some few daies before his dissolution, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing desired to give some, that visited him, a little tast of his
<pb facs="tcp:205094:5"/>present hopes, together with the grounds of them, for their comfort and instruction. He cheerfully answered, <hi>I will let you know, how it is with me, and upon what ground I stand.</hi> Then stretching forth his hand, he spake to this effect, <hi>Here is the grave, the wrath of God, and devouring flames, the just punishment of sin, on the one side; and here am I, a poor sinfull soul, on the other; but this is my comfort, the Covenant of Grace, which is established upon so many sure promises, hath salved all: There is an Act of Oblivion passed in Heaven: I will forgive their iniquities, and their sinnes will I remember no more, saith God. This is the blessed priviledge of all within the Covenant, among whom I am one. For, I finde the Spirit, which is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, bestowed on me, in the blessed effects of it upon my soul, the pawns of Gods eternall love; by it, I know my interest in Christ, who is the foundation of the Covenant, and therefore my sinnes being laid on him, shall never be charged on me.</hi> When the time of his dissolution approached, He called for his nearest relations, his Wife and Children; <hi>He commended them to God, the living God, the everlasting Father, with blessings and prayers, that they may have their part and interest in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Covenant, laying a charge upon them all, that they should continue still to give themselves to reading the Scriptures.</hi> When the earthly house of his tabernacle was even upon the point to be dissolved, with much adoe he uttered these words, <hi>My dissolution is more comfortable to me, than was my mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-day.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.57, 58.</note>
               <hi>Now thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore my beloved Brethren be ye stedfast, unmoveable, alwaies abounding in the work of the Lord; forasmuch as you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> Though it was the desire of our deceased Brother, that I should not make any solemn narration of his demea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour here among you, yet I cannot but speak something of him, that we may glorifie God in him, and for him; and to stirre up my self, and you, to an imitation of those graces of God, which were so eminent in him. We are to take special notice of it, that by the strength of Gods grace he remained stedfast and unmoveable in the Articles of our holy Religion in these declining times. Being asked upon a time, <hi>why he
<pb facs="tcp:205094:5"/>continued so resolved in his way, when as so many did in divers things alter their opinions?</hi> His answer was this, <hi>Because he did ground himself upon the Word of God, which is not altered.</hi> He was not a <hi>reed</hi> shaken with the winde, but a <hi>pillar</hi> in the house of God. He could professe it with holy <hi>Job,</hi> according to his degree and measure,<note place="margin">Job 23.10, 11, 12.</note>
               <hi>But he knoweth the way that I take, when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold; my foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not declined, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have I gone back from the commandment of his lips.

               <hi>He continued stedfastly in the Apostles do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and fellowship, and breaking of bread, and prayers:</hi> in breaking of bread, when as we have so many half-Ministers of late, who doe only preach the Word without administring the seals, the Sacraments which are annexed to it. He had a singular dexterity in Catechizing, in opening the grounds of our holy Religion, in a perspicuous clear manner, to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of the meanest. He did feed <hi>Christs lambs,</hi> as well as his <hi>sheep.</hi> He took great delight in it, he would often say, That <hi>if he had done any good here among you, it was by catechizing.</hi> Where let me in a word commend this necessary part, though so generally neglected of our Ministeriall function, to his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-labourers, who have so lovingly assisted him for so long time together; that they would effectually set themselves to it, that so they may by Gods blessing reap the like benefit and comfort that he did. How cheerfull was he in his going out, and coming in among you, in publick, and in private? How was his <hi>heart lifted up in the waies of the Lord?</hi> He did <hi>serve the Lord with his spirit, in the Gospel of his Son;</hi> he was a <hi>workman that need not be ashamed;</hi> he preached in <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the spirit, and in power;</hi> He was able to <hi>convince gain-sayers.</hi> In his Sermon, which he was importuned to print at <hi>Oxford,</hi> after he had preached it there, how does he wooe those that are off from family-exercises, to <hi>remember</hi> from whence they are <hi>fallen,</hi> and to doe their <hi>first works?</hi> His
<pb facs="tcp:205094:6"/>words are to this effect, When you were wont to pray with your Families, to repeat Sermons, to instruct and catechize your Children and Servants, was not that your best time? and it is great pity they did not listen to the voice of this <hi>charmer,</hi> who did <hi>charm so wisely.</hi> He went over the whole body of Divinity among you. He acquainted you with the whole counsel of God. He spent himself for you. God grant your profiting may prove in some sort answerable to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devours. He was constant in the duty of prayer and supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with thanksgiving; 'twas a branch of his daily devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, That God would be pleased to assist him mightily in his last conflict; and he did, as he told some of his friends that were about him<note n="*" place="margin">Blessed be God.</note>, reap the benefit of it. He was so farre from being affrighted at the approach of death, that he lifted up his hand, and his eyes, and with a serene cheerfull counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance yeelded up his soule into the hands of his faithfull Creator, and Redeemer. He was daily mindfull of you, the people of this place, which he had the cure of, in his prayers. Not long before his departure he lifted up his heart to God, for a good successour for you, as <hi>Moses,</hi> the servant of the Lord did,<note place="margin">Num. 17.16.</note> when he was to be gathered to his Fathers, <hi>Let the Lord the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man over the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, which may go out and in before them; that the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepheard.</hi> The Lord make good that gracious promise to you,<note place="margin">Ier. 3.15.</note>
               <hi>And I will give you Pastours according to mine own heart, which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</hi> Onely acknowledge your iniquity as the Prophet exhorts,<note place="margin">Ver. 13.</note>
               <hi>That you have trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressed against the Lord your God, and that you have not obeyed his voice,</hi> which so oft sounded forth unto you in his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery. Now suffer I beseech you one word more of exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Heb. 6.11, 12.</note> and it is that of the Apostle, <hi>And we desire, that every one of you doe shew the same diligence, to the full assurance of hope unto the end. That ye be not slothfull, but followers of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</hi> O that this may be the issue of our thoughts and meditations, as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our deceased Brother, and Fellow-labourer, and your faithfull Minister, of our coming to the house of mourning,
<pb facs="tcp:205094:6"/>of our accompanying the herse, of our solemn assembling our selves together in this place, that we may be excited by occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion hereof, and so effectually wrought upon, that we may tread in his steps. <hi>Non est amicorum prosequi defunctos igna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo questu, sed, quae voluerint, meminisse, quae mandaverint, exequi.</hi> It is not sufficient for friends, that they doe bewail and mourn over those that are departed from them after a dull fruitlesse manner, but it is by all means required that they follow the counsell and good advice they gave them, that they imitate the good example they left behinde them. Let us think with our selves, that we doe hear our deceased Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and your Pastour, speaking thus unto us, as the Apostle did to his Philippians, <hi>Finally brethren,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil 4.8, 9.</note>
               <hi>whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honest, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seever things are of good report: if there be any vertus, and if there be any praise, think on these things.

Secondly, their <hi>Food,</hi> by <hi>Milke</hi> he understands the plainest and easiest principles of Religion; by <hi>strong meat,</hi> the more profound and difficult points of the Christian Faith, such as is the Analogy between the Priesthood of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> and of <hi>Christ,</hi> of which he was about to speak, <hi>Chapter</hi> 5.11. <hi>of whom he had many things to say, and hard to be uttered, because they were dull of hearing</hi> Thirdly, their <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Dispraise;</hi> of the weak, he saith <hi>that they are unskilfull or unexperienced in the word of Righteousnesse,</hi> that is, in the Doctrine of the Gospell; The maine subject whereof is, the true and onely righteousnesse of Faith (that is) of Christ imputed unto us, by the grace of God, and the righteousnesse of Sanctification, which is wrought in us by the Spirit of Christ: This was the fault of the weak Christian.—Of the strong Christians he sayes, that they are able to deale in higher points, able to apprehend and digest them in their spirituall judgement. As solid and hard meats are not proper food for Children, but for men of full age and strength to feed on: so high and profound
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205094:12"/>Doctrine is not fitting for Novices, but for Christians of ripe age.—These he calls perfect, or of full age, not absolutely, (for the best do see but through a Glasse darkly) but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively in respect of the weak, whom he likeneth unto Babes. Fourthly, the meanes of ripenesse. These Perfect ones, by reason of long use and practice have their senses ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised, as in a School or University,<note place="margin">

As the Taste discernes of Meats, and the Eye of Colours, and the Eare of sounds; so can this mans understanding spiritually discerne between Colour and Colour, between Taste and Taste, between Light and Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, between Sour and Sweet, between Food and Poison, between Good and Evill: Even as Artists in any faculty can quickly espy, when their worke is well or ill done: And this is the commendation of the strong.

Thus you see that unto Diligence in hearing, Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans must adde Prudence in discerning. The end of Scripture is to make us wise to salvation, wise to discerne the voice of the Tempter from Gods voice, to know a false Prophet, though he come in Sheeps cloathing.

               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <p>THe first and most dangerous Error is of them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or overthrow the Divine Authority of Scriptures, making the Word of God of none effect: There is nothing more contrary to the corrupt Nature of Man, than the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures; Nothing more contrary to the Kingdome of Satan, than the Scriptures; And therefore lest his Impostures and Deceits should be discovered by the light of the Word, he sets himselfe by all meanes to overthrow the Scriptures, to enervate and weaken their Authority, and the high esteem we ought to have of them. Satan hath many Arts and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to undermine and destroy the Church of Christ: First, Sometimes by open Persecution, as in the first three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after Christ;<note place="margin">Gal. 2.4. 2 Cor. 11. Acts 20.</note> Secondly, by false Apostles, and false Brethren, which arise and speak perverse things, bring in damnable heresies, denying the Lord that bought them, and the very God-head of Christ and his satisfaction, such were the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and those swarms of Heretiques, which were hatcht by the warmth of peace and favour bestowed on the Church in the Age next following, and the Socinians of this Age. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8 10 11. we read of a <hi>great Starre,</hi> burning like a Lampe that fell from Heaven; the name of the Starre is <hi>Wormwood,</hi> it made the waters bitter, and many dyed of the waters, because they were bitter.—When the burning Stars of the Church fall from Heaven, their pernicious Doctrines are like Wormwood, which kill them that drinke thereof. Thirdly, sometimes by setting and fomenting divisions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians, Preacher against Preacher, Church against Church, well knowing, that a house divided against it selfe cannot stand. Fourthly, But all this might be to little
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:205094:14"/>purpose, so long as we have a <hi>sure word of Prophesie,</hi> a sure rule to have recourse unto, upon all occasions, as unto a <hi>light</hi> that shines in the darkest times, as unto living speaking Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, holding forth unto us the minde of God, whereby Truth is manifested, and counterfeit Doctrines discovered.</p>
                  <p>I shall not trouble you with the <hi>Popish</hi> controversies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Scripture, but apply my selfe to the Errors of the present Age.</p>
                  <p>The Sectarian Errors in particular,<note place="margin">Three Errors touching Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures. <hi>Loud: Test. pag.</hi> 5.</note> concerning the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures are three, in these expresse words of the <hi>London</hi> Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. <hi>First, That the Scripture, whether true Manuscript or no, whether</hi> Hebrew, Greek, <hi>or</hi> English, <hi>is but humane, so not able to discover a divine God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second is, <hi>that it is no foundation of Christian Religion, to believe that the</hi> English <hi>Scriptures</hi> (<hi>or that Book, or rather volume of Bookes called</hi> the Bible, <hi>translated out of the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> Hebrew <hi>and</hi> Greek <hi>Copies into the</hi> English <hi>Tongue</hi>) <hi>are the word of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Third is, <hi>that questionlesse no Writing whatsoever, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Translations or Originalls, are the foundation of Christian Religion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For discovery and Confutation of which cursed Errors, I chose for my Text, the words of Christ; <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5.39.</note> &amp;c. The great Question of all Religion was here in debate between <hi>Christ</hi> and the <hi>Jewes,</hi> touching the Person, Calling, and Doctrine of <hi>Christ,</hi> whether they were of God, yea or no, the <hi>Jewes</hi> denyed it, <hi>Christ</hi> proves it by four Testimonies. First, of his Father, ver. 32. <hi>I beare not witnesse of my selfe, there is another that beareth witnesse of me, and I know that his witnesse is true;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note> the Father bare witnesse to Christ at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, by that voice from Heaven in the Audience of all the people, saying, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased,</hi> as Christ applyes it, <hi>ver.</hi> 37. of this <hi>Chapter.</hi> And at his Transfiguration; <hi>Mat.</hi> 17.25.<note place="margin">2 Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 1.17.</note> which Testimony Saint <hi>Peter</hi> highly magnifies, saying, that he <hi>received from God the Father, Honour and Glory, when there came such a voice to him from that excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:205094:15"/>
                  <p>The second Testimony is, that of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist,</hi> who was sent from God, and acknowledged by the Jewes, <hi>ver.</hi> 33. <hi>You sent unto</hi> John, <hi>and he bare witnesse unto the Truth,</hi> But sayes Christ, <hi>I receive not Testimony from Man,</hi> (that is) I doe not rest nor stand so much upon <hi>John</hi>'s Testimony, onely I make use of it, as a man approved by your selves, that you might believe, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. for if ye believe <hi>John,</hi> you will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in me.</p>
                  <p>The third Testimony is by his workes, <hi>ver.</hi> 36. <hi>But I have greater witnesse than that of</hi> John, <hi>for the workes, which the Father hath given me to finish, bear witnesse of me, that the Father sent me; but ye receive not my Fathers Testimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning me, because his word is not in you,</hi> you doe not know your owne Scriptures, <hi>ver.</hi> 38.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Testimony is by the Scriptures, even the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets;</hi> by them Christ offers to be tryed and judged, <hi>ver.</hi> 39.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> as if he should say, If those Scriptures which your selves acknowledge to be of God, (and doe daily read) if they doe not testifie of me, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject me for a Counterfeit; but if they doe, then take heed that ye refuse me not. Christ doth appeale to their owne judgements, you think (and you think aright) that Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be found in the Scriptures, if you search them as you ought, with an intent to finde the <hi>Messiah,</hi> the Time, Person, Office, Doctrine and description of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> you will finde that they testifie of me, <hi>for they are they, which testifie of me, ver.</hi> 39.</p>
                  <p>The words clearly hold forth these four Truths, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct: </seg>1</label> opposite to the forecited errours. That the Scripture is of Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, the Supreme and last judge determining in all things (which God hath ordained to Salvation) what is good, and what is evill, what is sound, and what unsound, what is of God and to be believed, and what not; And into it our Faith doth finally resolve and rest it selfe, as being of Divine Authority, from whence, there is no appeale. Therefore in this debate touching the Person, Office, and Doctrine of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> Christ appeales to Scriptures, to be tryed by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:205094:15"/>them, they must justifie and condemne all mens opinions and actions.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures of the Old Testament are still of Divine Authority to the Churches of Christ under the Gospell, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct: </seg>2</label> to try, judge and determine, in matters of Faith and Duty, so that any Doctrine, Opinion, as also any Morall action by them Justified or Condemned, are to be accounted, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified and Condemned by God himselfe; (the inference is clear, for at that time, there was no other part of Gods will committed to writing, but that of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>To believe the Scriptures (which we are to search) whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Originalls, or in the English Translation, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct: </seg>3</label> to be the word of God, and to containe in them the minde and will of God concerning mans Salvation, is a necessary foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Christian Religion, else to what end did Christ bid the Jewes <hi>Search the Scriptures,</hi> if the beliefe of what we search be not the foundation of our Religion? Therefore the proper end of that search is to beget Faith and Religion in those Jewes, with whom he had to deale; And for En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men to believe the English Scriptures to be Gods Word, is as necessary a foundation of our Religion, as it is for the Jewes to believe the same word in the Hebrew Text to be of God.</p>
                  <p>The written word of God both in the Originalls, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct: </seg>4</label> and true Translations of them, are the foundation of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and of all things, that lead to it (for in them ye thinke to have eternall life) and so ye have indeed, because they preach Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I begin with the first Doctrine (namely) that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is of Divine Authority, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Proofes. </seg>
                     </label> the last and Supream judge in matters of Faith and Duty. This is proved by the judgement and practice of our Saviour, in deciding matters of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie in Religion by Scripture: Thus in that differene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Pharisees</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> about the Resurrection, and determines the Controversie by Scriptures, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29. <hi>Ye doe erre, not knowing the Scriptures,</hi> (as if he said) see what the Scripture speakes of that point, and accordingly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:205094:16"/>the question was judged on the <hi>Pharisees</hi> side (namely) that there was a Resurrection; Againe, when that Lawyer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed a question about Salvation, Christ sends him to the Scriptures to be resolved,<note place="margin">Luke 10.26.</note>
                     <hi>How readest thou?</hi> what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? Thus in doubtfull times, when different opinions and wayes were countenanced, the people are directed by <hi>Isa.</hi> 80.20. to resort <hi>to the Law, a d to the Testimonies;</hi> the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moses</hi> and the <hi>Prophets</hi> are called <hi>the Testimonies,</hi> because they testifie Gods minde to Man, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it we appeale for determination of every matter. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> writing to all that had obtanied the like <hi>pretious Faith</hi> with the Apostles, doth commend the Scriptures as the highest and surest foundation of Faith,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note>
                     <hi>We have a more sure word of Prophecy, to which ye doe well, that ye take heed, as unto a light:</hi> ye doe ill, saith the Sectary, because it is a living upon the Letter, and a way beneath for infant-Christians to walke by, it is but humane; Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith ye doe well, and which of these two shall we believe? them that say ye doe ill, or Saint <hi>Peter</hi> that sayes, ye doe well? But to observe <hi>Peters</hi> reason, ye doe well to take heed to Scriptures, because it is not humane, <hi>it came not by the will of Man, but holy men of God speak as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, ver.</hi> 21.</p>
                  <p>Because the Scripture hath in it all the Properties of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>
                     </label> Look what the Law is in the Common-wealth, the same is the Scripture in the Church: As the Law hath supreme Authority to judge and determine between Man and Man in all causes civil, so hath the Scripture in the Church for matters of Faith and Salvation: And as in matters of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, between Man and Man, we say, Let the Law try it, and there we rest; so is the Scripture for matters of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: none is higher than God, whose voice and Law it is, and therefore it is Supreme.</p>
                  <p>Now the Properties of a Supreme Judge or Ruler are espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially three;<note place="margin">Three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Iudge.</note> First, <hi>Infallibility,</hi> and fulnesse of knowledge, whereby we are assured that his verdict is true; for if a Judge be weak in knowledge, if he doth not clearly understand the matter, whereof he is to judge; if he himselfe may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:205094:16"/>then he cannot be a competent Judge, he cannot be Supreme, it is fit there should be an appeale from him. But now the Scripture delivers the infallible Truths of God, God is not deceived, neither doth he deceive any man. And it delivers all Truths that are sufficient and needfull for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. <hi>The Scriptures are able to make one wise unto Salvation;</hi> now that is sufficient knowledge for any man that can save him.<note place="margin">Things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are either <hi>credenda,</hi> or <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cienda.</hi>
                     </note> And this the Scripture doth performe as it is proved, <hi>ver.</hi> 16. by an enumeration of all things necessary for Salvation. First, the Scripture teacheth me what Doctrines I must hold, and what I should not hold; <hi>It is profitable for Doctrine.</hi> Secondly, it Confutes my Errors, it is profitable for <hi>reproof,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for confutation of Error. Thirdly, for practise, what is good and what is evill, the Scripture instructs us fully, therefore he sayes, <hi>it instructs in Righteousnesse,</hi> that is, in all points of duty, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me what I must do. Fourthly, if I go awry, it is profitable for <hi>Correction,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to set me right againe. And these four things it doth so fully,<note place="margin">Four parts of a Ministers preaching office.</note> that by it <hi>the man of God is made perfect,</hi> throughly furnished, unto all parts of his office, that is, to teach first the Principles of Christian Religion; Secondly, reproof of Errors, and false Doctrines; Thirdly, for Correction of life and evill manners; Fourthly, Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in the precepts of Holy Life and Christian Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And these things are easie enough to be understood, These are the true sayings of God; when we teach you, that we are by Nature children of Wrath, and the necessity of Regeneration, that we have Redemption by Faith in Christs Blood, That there shall be resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust, and of the Judgement to come. Also when we teach you, that you must repent of your sinnes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend your lives, take care to profit by hearing the Word, keep the Sabbaths, exercise your selves in the duties of Prayer, Praises, Chastity, Humility, Temperance, Mercy, Justice, Peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness, &amp;c. when we teach &amp; perswade such things as these, we have clear and full Scripture on our sides,<note place="margin">Rev. 22.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>6.</note> and may say of all the Scripture, as S. <hi>John</hi> of his Revelation, <hi>These sayings are faithfull and true, because the Lord God of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205094:17"/>sent them to shew these things unto his Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Property is, <hi>unpartiality,</hi> he that is supreme Judge among men, needs not through fear or favour to be partiall in Judgement, because he is above all, he must not accept the Person of any, nor regard the Faces of Men: Now the Scripture is like God the Law-giver, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts no mans Person; they that walke in the light of the Word, are Blessed; they that doe not, are accursed: <hi>for we call unto God the Father, who without respect of Persons, judgeth according to every mans worke,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. He makes no difference between Jew or Gentile, Bond or Free; and as God himselfe is no accepter of Persons, so neither is his Word.<note place="margin">Jam. 1.25.</note> Saint <hi>James</hi> calls it <hi>a perfect Law of Liberty.</hi> The Scripture will flatter none, it Justifies the Doers, and Condemnes the Transgressors without partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. Lying, Perjury, Covetousnesse, Ambition, Rebellion, Murder, Oppression of the People in their Properties, Estates, and Consciences, by unjust Subscriptions, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, unmercifulnesse, &amp;c. are sin in Protestants, as well as Papists; in a Parliament, and Committee, as well as in a Court or Councell Table; in a reputed Saint, as well as in a reputed Carnall man: though men dare not say so, yet the Scripture dares,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.9.</note>
                     <hi>Tribulation and anguish upon the Soule of every one, that doth evill, upon the Jew first, and also upon the Gentile,</hi> if the Jew, (one of Gods Church) be guilty, upon him first, him will God punish first;<note place="margin">Amos 3.2. Rom. 2.1, 2.</note>
                     <hi>you have I known of all the Nations of the Earth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you will I punish for all your iniquities.</hi> God is a righteous Judge.</p>
                  <p>The third Property is <hi>Authority.</hi> There is no Appeale from the Supreme, this belongs not to every Judge. It is the peculiar Prerogative of the Supreme. Such a Judge is the Scripture; there lyes no Appeale from it: if the Scripture justifie thee and thy Actions, none can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne thee: But if the Scripture condemne thee, none can comfort thee; A man would not lye under a Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-curse for all the world, it will take hold on thee most certainly. Bring a crooked thing to the Rule,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205094:17"/>and you will perceive the crookednesse of it. Take a suspected piece of Silver, one sayes 'tis good, another sayes 'tis naught, bring it to the Touchstone that shewes the Truth.

But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the voice of God, the Judgement of God in Scripture is Authenticall and immutable, and shall stand for, or against us at the last day. The Writings and Mindes of men give way one to another, and are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one by another. But that which must correct all, is the Scripture, when that speaks, all must stop. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the Lord given it to all, and made it common to all, that by it all Controversies might be decided, all doubt resolved, all Heresies confuted, all Truths e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished, every Conscience guided, and every mans life framed. Nothing is sound, holy, just, or true, which does not agree with Scripture: and nothing is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sound, unjust, unholy, untrue, that is agreeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>

It is a childish way of reasoning, and a poor comfort for any one to plead thus, I am of this

It is not what this or that particular man sayes, be he never so high in Reputation for wisdome or holinesse.

Therefore be thou willing to be judged, ordered, and confuted by Scripture.</p>
                  <p>In matters speculative,<note place="margin">Acknowledge the Authority of Scripture in Practicalls.</note> in our disputes against Papists, we wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly admit the Scripture to be Judge; why not also in Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticals? in disputes against our lusts? against our friends? against our owne and their evill and crooked wayes? Men will hold what they list, such points as they never learned from Scripture, and doe what they list, trample the Law of God and Man under foot, and yet take it ill to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, confuted, or ordered by Scripture: Nay, some have so impudently proclaimed their Athiesticall contempt of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that they have not blushed to say, this is a Malignant Chapter, or a Malignant Text, a Malignant Psalme, when they and their Actions ahve not been able to resist nor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the brightnesse of that light, testifying of the unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantablenesse of their doings. O how doe men strive, and struggle against the light, to shuffle off the sentences of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, as if in some Cases it were defective, and no compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judge of Actions! This is reall Popery. Whereas the Scripture is full and cleer, but all the darknesse and difficulty ariseth from the deceitfulnesse of our hearts, we are in love with our owne wayes, and cannot submit our Lusts to be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned and Judged by Scripture. O let every sincere Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian thus resolve, if the Word be of highest Authority, then I must give it the highest place in my heart; I must Live by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:205094:18"/>the Word, and Act by the Word, and Dye by the Word. Perhaps thou mightest enjoy many worldly advantages, and favours, if thou wouldst comply with corrupt Times and Men, and so avoid many worldly troubles. But the word of God puts a Barre, my Judge is against me in the businesse, the Word of God is in my heart, as a burning fire, it tells me. I must not choose sinne to avoid afflictions; it tells me, that the load of one sinne is heavier than many afflictions: I cannot comply with such and such wayes, because my heart standeth in awe of Gods Word. Perhaps Princes and the Grandees of the world doe sit and censure thee, but the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest heart that ownes this Doctrine, will say, I had rather offend and displease them all, than offend thy Word,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.161.</note> which must be my Judge and theirs. <hi>I have hid thy word in my heart, that I might not sinne against thee.</hi>

                  <p>Is to vindicate the Authority of Scripture against all such as oppose or weaken it, and make it of none effect. A foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Error here to be confuted. The first of them, that make
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:205094:19"/>the Church the Judge over Scriptures; we embrace its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery, we build not upon its Authority. I shall not trouble the Reader with Confutation of Papists, who overthrow its high Authority, and esteem, two manner of wayes. First, by setting the Authority of the Church above the Scriptures: <hi>Major est Authoritas Ecclesiae, quàm Scripturae:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bellar. de verbo dei.</note> They teach that the Church (that is) the Pope in his Chaire, by reason of his infallibility, is the Judge on Earth, determining which bookes be Scripture, and which not, what is the sence and meaning of Scripture, against whose Judgement and Determination, there is no disputing or contravening. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they overthrow its supreme Authority,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Conc. Trid S.</hi> 4.</note> by equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing their Traditions with the Scripture. <hi>Traditiones sunt pari pietatis affectu cum Scripturis recipiendae.</hi> A strange pride to set up other Doctrines, which the Scripture never taught, to binde the Consciences with the Commandements and Decrees of Men.</p>
                  <p>But the Error I am now to deale with,<note place="margin">Second Error of them that appeale to the Spirit.</note> is that of the Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sphemous <hi>Anti-Scripturist,</hi> under which name I comprehend all such, as either deny them to be Divinely inspired and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of God, or else allowing their Divine Authority, yet refuse to submit to Scripture as the supreme and all-sufficient Judge, pretending to other Divine Revelations,<note place="margin">See that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise entituled <hi>a Blow at the Root,</hi> by a namelesse Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Printed, <hi>Anno</hi> 1650.</note> besides and beyond the written word, unto which upon all occasions they Appeal, as if the Scriptures were not able to acquaint the soul with the highest discoveries of Gods truth and minde. If they be urged with any proof out of the Old Testament, they reject it, as if the old Testament were anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated, and out of date: if they be pressed with a place in the new Testament, then they say that is not the meaning, which we produce, (because (say they) you have not the Spirit, the Spirit teacheth us otherwise. And thus under pretence of Inspirations of the Holy Ghost, and improvements beyond and above all Scripture, they strike at the root, and blow up the very foundation of all Faith and Religion, of all our hopes and comforts; these are the Devills Engineers: These doe flatly disauthorize the Word of God, and with it all that is built thereupon; for with the Scripture all Religion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:205094:20"/>must needs fall to ruine, (or at least stand upon uncertainties) for every one may pretend to the Spirit, with as much reason as any one, and perhaps one of these Spirits quite crosse to the other, and so there can be no evidence of Truth or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, of Sinne or Duty, but every one is left to be his owne Judge and Rule, and every one will be in the Truth, because he thinkes so.</p>
                  <p>Here therefore of their Error,<note place="margin">Of Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to the Spirit.</note> who Appeale from Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to the Spirit for triall of Truth, and for deciding of Doubts.</p>
                  <p>For the clear discovery of this Error, I shall declare two things; First, what we are to hold touching the Spirits revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to us the mind of God; 2ly. what we are to detest and abhor touching that matter. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">First. </seg>
                     </label> For the former, we hold and teach that the Spirit of God,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.17.</note> which did indite the Scripture, is a Spirit of Revelation, and Illumination given to all Gods people, for the acknowledging and understanding the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of Salvation, and the things that doe belong to our Spirituall Estate;<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> which otherwise cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood by any meer naturall understanding, or unregenerate man, though he hath the Scriptures in his hand, and doe read them. God by his Spirit hath in the Scripture revealed the Mysteries of Christ to the full; yet no man, which hath no more light, than the naturall light of his understanding, can conceive them aright, unlesse God by his Spirit doth reveale them to his heart. There is a two-fold light, one Externall,<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> shining in the Word; another Internall, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and bringing into our hearts the knowledge of the glory of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.6.</note> in the face of Jesus Christ, so that God doth give both light to the Word,<note place="margin">John 1.5.

God did set lights in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and an Eye in the Body to see them: If I point with my Finger to the Moon, or a Starre, which a Man would see, and he hath not Eyes to see my Finger or the Starre, the fault is not for want of shewing, nor in the Starre for want of light,<note place="margin">Ioh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Even so the things of God knoweth no Man, but the Spirit of God;</hi> And for this cause it is, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that <hi>God would give them the spirit of Revelation in the knowledge of Christ, to enlighten the Eyes of their understanding.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Where note first, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>1</label> that by the <hi>Spirit of Revelation</hi> is not meant that extraordinary Revelation, whereby things were made knowne to the Prophets, but that ordinary gift of il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, or that light, which the Spirit causeth to shine into our mindes, by helpe whereof spirituall things are made manifest to the Eye of our understanding: Even as by the light of the Sun, things bodily are made manifest to the Eye of the body.</p>
                  <p>Note secondly, that the Apostle prayes this for them, <label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">Psal. 119.18.</note> Thus the Spirit of God is a Spirit of Sanctification and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, enabling us to see more than we could see by the meer help of Reason, and this <hi>Spirit</hi> is promised to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, <hi>to guide them into all saving Truths,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.26, 27. <hi>These things have I written unto you, concerning them, that seduce you; But the same Anoynting teacheth you of all things, and is truth and is no lye, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.</hi> By these places you see, that we have need of the Spirit to enlighten our mindes to

                  <p>The judgement and determination of the Word of God (as Doctor <hi>Field</hi> excellently saith) is that wherein we finally rest as the Rule of our Faith;<note place="margin">Of the Church lib. 4. cap. 13.</note> and the light of Divine under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding is that, whereby we judge all things.</p>

If you aske me farther, how know you that God hath revealed these things? I answer, By infallible Testimonies and Signes from Heaven.

                  <p>By these three positions, you see the great use and force of reason, in matters of Faith; it lets into my Soule the Divine light of the Word, it tells me I have reason to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what seems contrary to reason, because God hath spoken it, and it assures me that God hath spoken those heavenly Mysteries.</p>

It is true, because that few are able to judge of themselves, God hath provided guides to help them, yet Christians must not resign up their wits and senses, to follow any humane guide whatsoever; our guides must not lead us blindfold, neither must we put out our eyes to follow them; we must see the reason and grounds whereupon he goes, and so follow him by our own reason: With my eyes I see his light; he tells me this is firm ground, you may go upon it, and I see it to be so.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>1</label> we ought to give glory to God in all his wonderfull works of providence, and that in these five parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: 1. We must take serious notice of his doings; for, <hi>the Lord hath so done his mervailous works,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psalm 105.2.</note> that they ought to be <hi>had in remembrance,</hi> yea, we must <hi>talk of his wondrous works,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 118.23.</note> and say, <hi>This hath the Lord done, and it is marvailous in our eyes. The works of the Lord are great, sought out of all that have pleasure therein.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 111.2, 4.</note>
                     <hi>But an unwise man regardeth them not. O Lord</hi> (saith David) <hi>How great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep: A bruitish man knoweth not, neither doth a foole understand this;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Psal. 92.5, 6.</note> and therefore God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry:<note place="margin">Psal. 28.5.</note>
                     <hi>Because they regard not the works of the Lord, nor the operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We must so observe them,<note n="2" place="margin">It is a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.

                     <note place="margin">Verse 10.</note>
                     <hi>and not behold the majesty of the Lord.</hi> By the seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Meditation of Providences much is to be learn'd; as first, sometimes by it we may learn to humble our souls under his mighty hand, and to amend our wayes, and to tremble be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him,<note place="margin">To see Gods anger. Gods love and faithfulnesse. Psal. 91.4. Job 5.19.</note> the people shall hear and see, and do no more so wickedly. Secondly, Sometimes we learn to see Gods love and faithfulnesse, and so grow up into a dependance on him in like cases. Thy <hi>faithfulnesse</hi> and <hi>truth</hi> shall be my <hi>shield</hi> and <hi>buckler. He shall deliver thee in six troubles, yea in seaven, there shall no evill touch thee.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contentation.</note> Thirdly, We may learn Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation, Cheerfulnesse, Thankfulnesse, in a low estate, &amp;c. by Gods dealings with our selves and others.<note place="margin">To suffer for his Name.</note> Fourthly, Providences do sometimes call us to Suffering, to Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:205094:26"/>to bear witness to his Truth, and against the Sins of the World.</p>
                  <p>Providence over-rules the Plots, Counsels,<note n="3" place="margin">It is an over, ruling Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and Works of Men, yea their Vices, and their naturall imaginations to bring to passe his own work, either of Mercy or Judgement. The Creature doth his own proper will, and works after his own lusts, drives on his own designes; But all this while God is above them, and brings to passe his own Counsels, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for mercy, as in the case of Christ: <hi>Herod,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 4.27.</note> and <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and the <hi>Jewes,</hi> laid their heads together, they were <hi>gathered together against Christ;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse. 28.</note> (that was their work) But Gods work was carried on by their wicked hands, <hi>to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever thy hand and thy counsell determined before to be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes for Judgement, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 10.5. <hi>O</hi> Assyrian! <hi>the Rod of mine anger, and the Staffe in their hand, is mine Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I will send him against an Hypocriticall Nation, I will give him a charge to take the spoile, and to tread downe like the mire in the street.</hi>—This is Gods work, by the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> to scourge his people. But the <hi>Assyrian</hi> did not propose to himself any such end as to serve God, but he drave on his own designes of Ambition and Covetousness, for he saith v. 7. <hi>He meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so:</hi>

                     <hi>But it is in his heart to destroy and cut off Nations, not a few.</hi>—Yea, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar</hi> in warring against <hi>Tyrus,</hi> is said to have <hi>wrought for God,</hi> and God payes him his wages, ver. 20. <hi>I have given him the land of</hi> Egypt <hi>for his labour, wherewith he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved against</hi> Tyrus, <hi>because they wrought for me saith the Lord;</hi> Though they did not know my will, nor had any intent to obey it, yet by their wicked hands the Lord executed his judgement on <hi>Tyrus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many times the passages of Providence are so strange,<note n="4" place="margin">It is an asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> and in that darknesse, that we cannot see Gods liking or disliking by them, as in <hi>Job</hi>'s case, we cannot tell what judgement to make upon them. Job 11.7. <hi>Canst thou by searching finde out God? Canst thou finde out the Almighty unto perfection? His judgements are unsearchable, and past finding out,</hi> Rom, 11.33. <hi>Iob</hi> could not find out God in his workings, though
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:205094:27"/>he sought it diligently. Job 23.8, 9. <hi>Behold I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceive him: on the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him; he hideth himself on the right, that I cannot see him: But he knowes the way that I take.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iob 9.10, 11, 12.</note>
                     <hi>He doth great things past finding out; Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not; he passeth on also, but I perceive him not: Behold he taketh away, Who can hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him? Who will say unto him, What doest thou?</hi> The Lord worketh by his Prerogative sometimes, and there is no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to be given for it; The Lord knowes all our wayes, paths &amp; turnings, but we cannot find out the reason of his dealings.</p>
                  <p>Yet we must still conclude,<note n="5" place="margin">It is a just Providence.</note> that in all Gods wonderfull Acts of Providence in the changes and alterations of the world, we must acknowledge his Justice, Soveraignty, Power and wisdome, though the instruments and their works be wicked, though his wayes be far above and out of our sight, his <hi>footsteps</hi> are in the <hi>Clouds,</hi> and in the <hi>great waters,</hi> yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mouth must confesse, that <hi>holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God of Hosts, the whole earth is full of his Glory,</hi> Isa. 6.3. This did the Angels proclaime before the throne of God, when he sate to Judge the earth.

                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">What we deny to Providence.</note> We must not make Providence a rule or judge of Duty, nor to be a warrant of our Actions: we must not accept the most signall demonstrations of Providence against a Scripture-rule; no alterations of Times, no successes of Providence, no Afflictions, no cross Accident should cause a godly soule to alter his Principles, nor to depart from the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:205094:27"/>words of Instruction, which we have received from the mouth of God, to build to our selves new perswasions, and actions upon new principles of providentiall favours or dis-favours; Learn this from <hi>Iob</hi>'s holy resolution, Job 23.9.<note place="margin">See Psal. 119.83, 84, 87.</note>
                     <hi>Though I cannot see him in his dealings towards me, yet my foot hath held his steps, his waies have I kept, and not declined, neither have I gone back from the commandement of his lipps:</hi> Nothing of Providence must alter the Rule.</p>
                  <p>This is proved by five Reasons: 1. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>5</label> Because God useth wicked men for his Instruments, and prospereth the Cause. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Prophet (<hi>Habakkuk</hi> 1.13.) expostulates with the Lord, and calls them wicked; <hi>Wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and boldest thy tongue when the wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth the man that is more righteous than he, and makest men as the fishes of the Sea, that have no Ruler over them?</hi> Here you see Gods vengeance executed by men that were far worse. Again, if providentiall successes declare Gods liking and our duty; and that they be Judges of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a Cause, then let the Mahumetans rejoice and boast in Religion, as they do, saying, God with an almighty hand from heaven hath approved it, with invincible prevailings against the Christians, &amp;c. If Providence must frame our judgement of any Matter, or Cause, or Opinion, then let <hi>Antiochus,</hi> the type of Antichrist, be a Saint, and judged to have God on his side, when he so miserably wasted the Jews. In <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.9, 10, si. we read, that out of one of them (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Seleucidae,</hi> which reigned in <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi>) came forth <hi>a little horn</hi> (that is) <hi>Antiochus Epiphanies,</hi> toward the South (that is, <hi>Egypt</hi>) and towards the East (that is, <hi>Persia</hi>) both which were conquered by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the pleasant Land (that is, the Land of <hi>Israel</hi> so called, for its blessed Priviledges) against these that Tyrant wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prevailed, ver. 10. for <hi>he waxed great, even to the host of Heaven,</hi> (that is, to war against Gods Church) <hi>and cast down some of the Host, and of the Starres, to the ground, and stamped upon them.</hi> Yea, ver. 11. <hi>He magnified himselfe even to the Prince of the Host, and by him the daily sacrifice was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, and the place of his Sanctuary was cast downe:</hi> And
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:205094:28"/>ver. 12. <hi>An Host was given against the daily Sacrifice, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of transgression,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan. 11, 30, 31, 32.</note>
                     <hi>and it cast down the truth to the ground, and it practised and prospered;</hi> Here's a wonderfull successe; and many of the Jewes seeing him thus to prosper, began to alter their Religion, to forsake the holy Covenant, <hi>for armes did stand on his part,</hi> that is, Power and Victory; <hi>and such as did wickedly against the Covenant, he corrupted by flatteries,</hi> &amp;c. I demand now, Was the cause of <hi>Antiochus</hi> just and good, because he prospered? Or did those Jewes do well, that changed their Minds and their Religion, and fell to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querours side, as if Gods minde had been hereby declared to alter the established Worship, or that Idolatry pleased him better than the daily Sacrifice, which was now took away? God forbid! Lastly, if successes must sway our opinions and practises, then why do we not turn Papists, and worship the <hi>Beast,</hi> Rev. 13.7. <hi>to whom it was given to make warre with the Saints, and to overcome them?</hi> What shall we think? Doth God by this successe, approve of the Beast, or of his War? Or must the Saints now alter their Principles, and worship the Beast? The Text (ver. 8.) tells us, that the gross number of people (which hang their Religion upon Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) shall worship him all, except they, <hi>whose names are written in the Book of Life.</hi>— Thus you see how God doth prosper the worst Cause, and the vilest of men; how the Lord doth make use of wicked Instruments to punish an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriticall Church:— And that they are the worst of men, even men that do wickedly against the Covenant, who change their Opinions with successes, and depart from the written Truth, as if God and his Word were changed with the change of the World. Read <hi>Ier.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3.</p>
                  <p>If Providence may set up new Rules of Opinion &amp; Practise, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label> then you may as well cast Lots of what Opinion and Religion, of what Side and Perswasion you will be; for as much as a Lot is guided by divine Providence. <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33. <hi>The Lot is cast into the Lap, but the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Successes of Providence may determine of Gods Will and our Duty, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> then you will be forced oft-times to Justifie and Condemn the same Cause and the same Persons, when
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:205094:28"/>this side prospers, O now, God, say they, hath declared himself, owned their Cause from Heaven; yea, some have not stuck to call <hi>Worcester</hi> the Valley of Decision, as if now all doubt and controversie touching the Kings Cause, and the new Common-wealth, were determined, past all dispute; But what if Providence takes against them? What if the Lord blasts their Counsels and their Power? Then the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Judgement is to be made (namely) that God doth not own our Cause, nor approve our doings; then we must by the same rule condemn our selves, and our former Actings,—unlesse you will say, that Providences may prescribe Duty, when they make for us, but not when they stand against us: and when God seems to plead the Cause of our Adversaries; (But this were Childrens play so to argue.)</p>
                  <p>If Providences alter the state of the Question, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>4</label> then a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject or design, singularly wicked, and abhorring to Nature and Religion, if it succeed well, does cease to be evil, which cannot enter into the thoughts of any but an Atheist, <hi>Felix scelus</hi> is <hi>scelus</hi> still: It is a sure rule in Divinity, that <hi>malum in se</hi>— (such are the sinnes against the Morall Law) cannot be made good by any Circumstances whatsoever. Sin is sin still, Murder, and Perjury, &amp;c. are sinnes still, and no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse can, or ought, to alter our judgement concerning them.</p>
                  <p>Nay lastly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>5</label> It is a judgement from God to prosper in wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness, and therefore no sign of his approbation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 92.7. <hi>When the workers of iniquity do flourish, it is that they shall be destroyed for ever.</hi> There's a sad reckoning; everlasting De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction for their present Prosperity:<note place="margin">Prov. 1.32.</note>
                     <hi>The prosperity of Fools destroyes them;</hi> through Gods just wrath their hearts are hardned, that they cannot repent.<note place="margin">Psal. 55.19.</note>
                     <hi>Because they have no Changes, therefore they fear not God.</hi> Their constant, and uninterrupted Posterity, is the reason of their perseverance in wickedness and contempt of God, through long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of sinning they grow obdurate, and hardned to their utter destruction. God sends Troubles and Afflictions to his children in mercy, and gives Prosperity to the ungodly, in wrath. Let God lay on me any affliction, rather than suffer me to prosper in the way that is evil: A hard heart is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:205094:29"/>a fearefull judgement, and <hi>Solomon</hi> observes <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.11, 12. that impenitencie is the fruit of such prosperity. <hi>Because sentence against an evill doer is not speedily executed; therefore the heart of the Sons of men is fully set in them to doe evill,</hi> they blesse themselves and say, No evill shall happen unto us. But what sayes the Lord, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>Though a sinner does evill an hundred times, and his dayes be prolenged, yet surely I know that it shall not be well with the wicked,</hi> their damnation slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth not, it is every day nearer and nearer, and the longer it stayes, the more heavy it will be; it comes with feet of Wool, but it will strike with hands of Lead, <hi>though it be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to be in safety, wherein he resteth,</hi> and feareth no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, <hi>yet his eyes</hi> (that is, Gods eyes) <hi>are upon their wayes; They are exalted for a little while, but are gone, and brought low, they are taken out of the way as all others, and cut off as the tops of the eares of Corn.</hi> See Job 24.23, 24.</p>
                  <p>I conclude therefore; that Providences are oftner a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, than a rule, a triall of our Uprightness, not a rule for our Consciences; he is a poor silly Soul, and yet a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous undertaker, that is not assured of the justness of his Cause, till the successe determine it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But is there no judging of Gods liking by his Providence?</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> There is much of Providence in great actions, but not of his will and liking, as hath been shewed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Providence following a promise, is a Token of his love and liking. So <hi>Joshuah</hi> might take comfort in his successfull war, <hi>Jos.</hi> 23.14. <hi>Not one good thing failed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is no comfort at all to be the rod and Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods anger or vindicative Providence on wicked men; for so was the King of <hi>Assyria,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Isa.</hi> 10. so was <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> and <hi>Jehu,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is no comfort to say, the will of God is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by us; and if it were not his will, this could not have been done: True; yet woe to that man, by whose sins and vices, God brings to passe his owne worke; <hi>The Son of man goeth, as it is written of him; Iudas</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> did no more but what was written, &amp; what the hand and Counsell of God had determined before to be done; <hi>yet woe be to that man,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:205094:29"/>by whom the Son of man is betraied; Good had it been for that man, that he had never been borne;</hi> The Instrument may be damned, though God made him his scourge; when the Child is corrected, the God is cast into the fire.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have at last finished my second use, wherein I have vindicated the supreme Authority of Scripture, against a foure-fold Error: First, of them that would place this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the Church. Second, of them who appeale from Scripture to the Spirit; Third, of them that make Reason the Supreme Judge; The fourth, of them that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Scripture according to Providences.</p>
                  <p>There remaines one Question to be resolved, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>
                     </label> for the close of this whole matter (namely) <hi>Into what then is our Faith fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally resolved, and whereupon doth it stay it selfe, seeing the forementioned things, the Church, the Spirit, Reason and Providence, though their help and Ministery be needfull, yet our Faith is not built upon them, as hath been shewed?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Authority and Truth of God speaking in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, is that upon which our Faith is built, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> and doth finally stay it selfe; The Ministery of the Church, the Illumination of the Spirit, the right use of Reason, and the choicest helps, by which we believe, by which we see the Law and will of God; But they are not the Law it selfe; the Divine Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods Word, is that which doth secure our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences.</p>
                  <p>To the grounding of Faith it is necessary, that we know,<note place="margin">Two things are required to the resolving and setling of Faith.</note> first, what is the truth revealed, for else we cannot believe it, nor rest upon an unknown Truth; Secondly that God hath indeed revealed and declared those truths; and then the soul resteth upon it, as a sure Anchor of faith and hope. If you ask what it is that I believe? I answer, I believe the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed doctrines of salvation by Jesus Christ; if you ask, why I believe all this, &amp; why I will venture my soul to all eternity on that doctrin? I answer, because it is the revealed will of God concerning us; This is the way of Salvation, which God hath made known to the Sons of men. If you ask further, How I knowt hat God hath revealed them? I answer, by a two-fold certainty; one of Faith, the other of Experience; First I do
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:205094:30"/>infallibly by faith believe the Revelation, not upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of any other Revelation but for it selfe, the Lord giving Testimony thereunto, not only by the constant Testimony of the Church,<note place="margin">Iohn 5.32.36. Luke 1.4.</note> which cannot universally deceive, nor only by miracles from heaven, bearing witnesse to the Apostles doctrine, but chiefly by its own proper divine light, which shines therein. The truth contained in scripture is a light, and is discerned by the Sons of light: It doth by its own light perswade us, and in all cases, doubts, and questions, it doth clearely testifie with us, or against us; which light is of that nature, that it giveth Testimony to it selfe, and receiveth Authority from no other, as the Sun is not seene by any light but his own, and we discerne sweet from sowre by its own Taste. And the meanes for opening our eyes to see this light (whereby our consciences are assured that we rest in God,) are diverse: first, some private, as Reading, Prayer, conference of places, consent of Churches in all Ages, Helps of learning, and reason sanctified.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, some publike, as the Ministery of the Word, which is the Ordinance of God to get this assurance, which Act of the Church is not Authority to secure me, but Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery to shew me, that which shall secure me, which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery is founded on the Scripture it selfe, in that from thence it fetcheth the reason that doth perswade me, and sheweth the light, that doth infallibly assure me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">1 Iohn 2.20. Eph. 1.17, 18. 1 Iohn 5.6, 9.</note> But the thiefe helpe, to shew me and assure me of this light, is the Holy Spirit, given to Gods children, in, and by the use of the former meanes to open our understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, to enlighten our mindes, that we may know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the words of this life, and the things which are freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto us of God; In which light thus shewn unto us, Faith staieth it selfe, without craving any further testimony or proofe, in the same manner that the Philosopher proveth, that with the same sense we see, and are assured we see: Thus I know by the certainty of Faith, resting upon its object, that the Doctrine of Scripture is from God: This is a certainty in respect of the understanding.</p>
                  <p>Whereunto adde, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> that other certainty of experience, which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:205094:30"/>is a certainty in respect of the Affections and of the spirituall man, This is the spirits Seale set to Gods truth, (namely) the light of the word; when it is thus shewen unto us, it doth worke such strange and supernaturall effects upon the soul; it doth <hi>renew us in the spirit of our minds,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.18.</note> we beholding this <hi>Glory of God</hi> in the Gospel are <hi>changed into the same image;</hi> it doth mightily convince our consciences;<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10, 4, 5.</note> it <hi>pulls down our strong holds of sinne;</hi> It <hi>casteth downe our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and reasonings,</hi> which would <hi>exalt themselves</hi> against the <hi>knowledge of God;</hi> It inflames the heart with love of God, hatred of Sinne; It fills the heart with joy and peace, such as the world cannot give; It perswades us of the truth and goodnesse of the will of God, and of the things revealed, and all this by way of spirituall taste and feeling, so that the things apprehended by us in Divine knowledge, are more certainly discerned in the certainty of experience, than any thing is discerned in the light of naturall understanding, (which hath the certainty of speculation onely, but not of experience. <hi>How sweet are thy words unto my Mouth! they are sweeter than honey, and the honey comb,</hi> Psal. 119.</p>
                  <p>They that are thus taught, doe know assuredly, that they have heard God himselfe: In the former way, the light of Divine Reason causeth approbation of the things they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. In the later, the Purity and power of Divine know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, causeth a taste and feeling of the things they heare: And they that are thus established in the Faith, doe so plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see God present with them in his Word, that if all the world should be turned into Miracles, it could not remove them from the certainty of their perswasion; you cannot unperswade a Christian of the truth of his Religion, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make him thinke meanly of Christ, nor the Doctrine of Redemption, nor of duties of Sanctification, his heart is fixed trusting in the Lord.

To what end should I search the Bible, rather than any other Book, if I do not think it to be of God? And I therefore search it, that I may know what Religion to be of, that is, what I must believe and professe; what God I must worship, and in what manner: The end of that searching was to beget Faith and true Religion in those unbelieving Jewes, with whom Christ had to deal. If I believe it not to be of God, I can have no foundation of my Religion. For true Religion is not the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of naturall Reason, or humane Wisdome, but of the will of God, declaring all matters of Faith, of Worship and Life. No man hath known God at any time,<note place="margin">True Religion is onely from God.</note> and as long as the World was without the revealed will of God, they wandred after the imaginations of their own hearts: so he tells the <hi>Galatians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 14.16.</note> c. 4.8. <hi>When ye knew not God, ye did service unto them, which by nature are no Gods:</hi> That which is not God by nature, is not God at all: There were Gods of Mens making: the Gods of the Nations were not Gods, but onely
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:205094:34"/>in the opinion and conceit of them that made them so: <hi>We know that an Idoll is nothing</hi> (that is) nothing indeed,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.4.</note> nothing but in the conceit of the Idolater, it is no such thing, as he takes it to be. Now that which is a God of mans making,<note place="margin">Deut. 32.17. Isa. 43.12. Jud. 5.8.</note> is not God. The Lord chargeth the people with this folly, <hi>they Sacrificed unto Devils, not to God, to Gods whom they knew not, to new Gods that came newly up:</hi> whereas the true God is not a made God, he is a God whether we think it or not, he is God by his own nature, the ever living and eternall God, in the knowledge and true worship of him does all true Religion consist, and therefore in compassion to the World, God sent unto the Jewes first, his Word, his Statutes,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.3.</note> and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, a choice Priviledge. <hi>Chiefly, because unto them were committed the Oracles of God:</hi> And in the <hi>fulnesse of time</hi> he brought the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into fellowship with the <hi>Iewes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 14.15.</note> and <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them from their vanities unto the Living God, which made Heaven and Earth, the Sea, and all things therein. You know</hi> (sayes Paul to the Thessalonians, 1 Ep. 1.9.) <hi>How ye turned to God from Idols to serve the living and true God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All religion is either the invention of men, or of God; if our Religion be after the Inventions and Commandements of men, it is all in vaine. <hi>Mark</hi> 7.7.<note place="margin">Col. 2.23.</note>
                     <hi>In vaine doe they Worship me, teaching for doctrines the Commandements of men,</hi> although they carry the greatest shew of wisdome, humility, and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity. That which the Lord hath commanded us, that only may we doe; <hi>whatsoever things I command you observe to doe it, thou shalt not adde thereto, nor diminish from it. Deut.</hi> 12.32. His will revealed is the only true ground of all Religion, and the measure of his Worship; if we doe any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, nay, if any thing besides what he commands, it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination: The Prophet <hi>Ieremy</hi> speaking of the peoples inventing additionall services does condemne them in this very respect, because <hi>God commanded them not, nor spake it, neither came it into his mind,</hi> Jer. 19.5. If it came not into his mind, then not from his mind to us; And therefore that Religion is all in vaine. Let this then be first setled in your minds, that the word of God is the only foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion.</p>
                  <pb n="48" facs="tcp:205094:35"/>
                  <p>And for the right grounding of our Religion, it is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary that we believe it to be so; To believe the scriptures to be the word of God, is the foundation of Christian Religion, <hi>We are built upon the foundation</hi> (that is upon the doctrine) <hi>of the Prophets and Apostles,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 2.20.22.</note> and <hi>Faith</hi> is it, that causeth us to <hi>rest</hi> thereon; therefore it is called <hi>the word of faith;</hi> it must be received as from God, believed as Gods word; if we doe not believe it to be the word of God, we have no reason to ground our Religion upon it, more than upon the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> if we doe not believe it to be the word of God, we have no faith, and consequently no Religion. Thus Christ argueth <hi>Ioh.</hi> 5.46, 47. <hi>Had ye believed Moses, you would have belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me, but if ye believe not his writings, How shall ye believe my words?</hi> To believe the scriptures to be the word of God, is the ground of faith, and therefore the foundation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Religion.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> because these Translations are not infallible, as the Rule of Faith must be; for neither were the Scripture immediately written by the Holy Ghost in our language neither were the Translators assisted by the Spirit infallible, as appeares by the often change, and correcting of the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slations,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>White</hi>'s way to the Church. 5.6.</note> which shews, that some of them were defective.— How can an unlearned man be sure, that this Translation, which now I have, or you have, does not erre, unless you admit the Authority of the Church, to assure us, that such and such a Translation doth not erre?</p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:205094:35"/>
                  <p>For answer hereunto, I lay down these two Conclusions: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> First, that Divine Truth in English, is as truly the Word of God, as the same Scriptures delivered in the Originall, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew or Greek; yet with this difference, that the same is perfectly, immediately, and most absolutely in the Originall Hebrew and Greek, in other Translations, as the vessels wherein it is presented to us, and as far forth as they do agree with the Originalls: And every Translation agreeing with the Originall in the matter, is the same Canonicall Scripture that Hebrew or Greek is, even as it is the same Water, which is in the Fountain, and in the Stream; we say this is the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of such or such a Well, or Spring, because it came from thence; so it is in this business, when the Apostles spake the wonderfull works of God in the languages of all Nations (that were at <hi>Jerusalem</hi>) wherein they were born; the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine was the same to all,<note place="margin">Acts 2.8 11.</note> of the same Truth and Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in the severall Languages: And this Doctrine is the Rule we seek for, and the foundation upon which our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is grounded, and it is all one thing, whether it be brought to my understanding in Welch, or English, or Greek,<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>White</hi>'s way S. 5.2.</note> or Latine: All Language, or Writing, is but the Vessell, the Symbole, or Declaration of the Rule, not the Rule it self: It is a certain form or means by which the divine Truth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth unto us, as things are contained in their words, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Doctrine and matter of the Text<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s not made known unto me but by words, and a language which I understand; therefore I say, the Scripture in English is the rule and ground of my Faith; whereupon I relying, have not a humane, but a divine Authority for my Faith. Even as an <hi>unbeliever</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to our Sermons, is <hi>convinced of all,</hi> and <hi>judged of all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.24.</note> and he will acknowledge the Divine Truth of God, although by a humane voice in preaching, it be conveyed unto him, so we enjoy the infallible Doctrine of the Scripture, though by a mans Translation it be manifested unto me.</p>
                  <p>My second conclusion is this; That to believe this to be so (that is) to believe the scripture in English to be the word of God, is a necessary meanes for grounding of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in the hearts of English people.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:205094:36"/>
                  <p>The reason is, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> because the rule of faith must be first both certaine, and Secondly known. For if it be not certaine, it is no rule at all, and if it be not known, it is no rule to us. Wherefore God hath taught us by corporall letters,<note place="margin">White's way. pag 17.</note> which we see and read, what he would have us believe concerning him; But to him that heareth not, or that believeth not, Truth and Error, light and darknesse is all one. Observe the Apostles reasoning,<note place="margin">Rom. 10.14.</note>
                     <hi>How shall they call on him, in whom they have not believed?</hi> (believing you see is the foundation of that part of Christian Religion, (namely) holy invocation) <hi>and how shall they believe in him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Thes. 2.13.</note>
                     <hi>of whom they have not heard?</hi> if they doe not understand the minde of God by hearing, and hearing it <hi>as from God,</hi> as <hi>the word of God and not of Man,</hi> it is no more than if they heard a piece of <hi>Virgil,</hi> or <hi>Cesars Commentaries;</hi> for how can we preach to the convincing of consciences, and setling of their souls in the way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, except they be perswaded, that he that preacheth, speaketh from God?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label> what comfort can there be in that Religion, which we are not perswaded is of God? no Religion is able to bring us unto God, but that which came from God, if I doubt of that, I have no Religion at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But how can we believe the Scriptures translated into En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Let the English Translation of the Bible stand for true, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> untill the Jesuite or the Sectary be able to prove the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O, but I cannot believe them to be true, because the Translators were not assisted immediately by the holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such extraordinary assistance is needfull to one, that shall indite any part of Scripture, but not to a Translator, for a man by his skill in both Languages, by the ordinary helps of prayer and industry is able to open in the English tongue, what was before lockt up in the Originall Hebrew, or Greek. As a Spanish or Danish Embassadour, delivers his Message, and receives his answer by an Interpreter. — The interpreter
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:205094:36"/>needs not any inspiration, but by his skill in both languages, and his fidelity, he delivers the true mind of one Nation to another: So it is in this case, the Translator is Gods inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter to a strange people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Oh! But by the often change and variable Translations,</hi>

                  <p>The Translation is done by the Ministery of the Church, and industry of certain men; And although they be not Priviledged from mistakes, yet we know infallibly, that they have not erred in the matter: we know it, I say, by the same meanes, whereby we know other Truths and Articles of Faith,<note place="margin">2 By the Lights that shine in the Translati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> (namely) by the light of the doctrine translated; for the doctrine contained in the Scripture, is a light, and so it abideth, into what language soever it be Translated, and the children of light know it, and discern it, (as is at large discoursed already) for they <hi>know his voice from all others.</hi>

                     </gap>, which is to set forth the Excellencies of God, His grace, wisdom, mercy, &amp;c. And to abase man, to bring us back to God, to possesse and enjoy him, to be partakers of his holinesse and glorious Excellencies.<note place="margin">Acts 26.18. Eph. 2.1.18.</note> The generall scope of Scripture is to make us holy, and whatsoever inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation doth draw us from duty, if the fruit and effect of the Exposition lead unto sin and looseness, it is a false sense, it is not of the spirit of God: mark what their Doctrine drives at,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.15, 16.</note> and <hi>by the fruit</hi> of their doctrine <hi>ye shall know them.</hi>
                  </p>

                     </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Construction will yeild and beare, else it is a false sense: No Commentary must overthrow the Text; every Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion must be such, as the words in their true signification, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper, or figurative, do yeild: No Exposition of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is to be accepted, which the words taken with their scope will not bear. The Litterall sense is not onely that which the words do properly afford, but also that which they afford in their borrowed sense, according to the intention of him that speaketh, and the matter which he would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood by the comparisons, wherewith things are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; so that look what it is that God would have us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:205094:38"/>by the words of Scripture properly used, or figurative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that is the literal sense, and the true meaning of the place. Here you must remember also, that the intent and scope of the place is to be gathered by what goes before, and what follows after the Text, that is in debate: you must not take a part of a Scripture-sense, and leave out the other part.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and last Rule to judge between a true and false sense, is this, You must compare one place with another, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>4</label> and the plainer places must be the rule to expound the more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure: But beware that ye never accept of a mysticall and dark place against a plain place; never forsake a plain place to follow those which are dark and mysterious. It is the pride of many, both Preachers and others, to be dealing in the darkest places of Scripture, (of <hi>Daniel</hi> and the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>) and by the sound of some words not well understood, to ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Why doe not you that are Preachers better agree in your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions? You differ among your selves,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> Though we make different observations upon the same Text, yet not one contrary to another: The fulness of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is such, that one man sees farther than another into a Text, yet all bear witness to the same Truth of God. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> came both of them to the Sepulchre, to see whether Christ were risen; <hi>Iohn</hi> came first, yet went not in, onely he saw the linnen clothes lying; but <hi>Simon Peter</hi> went into the Sepulchre, and taketh a particular view of all things, yet both saw enough, and both were witnesses to the same truth: so it is in expounding of Scriptures, some see and declare the truth in a generall way, they come first to the Sepulchre, others dive deeper into the meaning, yet both are witnesses to the same Jesus, and to the word of his Truth: one true sense may be uttered diversly. All variety doth not make a contrariety of expositions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer, that for substance of Doctrine, there
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:205094:39"/>is a sweet Harmony among the Reformed Churches, so that you may go into a thousand Congregations, where our old sound Ministers are the Lights that shine, and you shall finde that they all speak the same thing, preach the same Jesus Christ, and walk after the same Spirit.</p>

                  <p>Many are the titles and Attributes given to Scripture, which report unto us their power, purity, and efficacy; it is called <hi>the word of life,</hi> Philip. 2.16. <hi>the word of Grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among them that are sanctified,</hi> Acts 20.32. <hi>The word of Truth, the Gospell of your Salvation, the ground of Faith,</hi> Eph. 1.13. <hi>the word of the kingdome,</hi> Mat. 13.19.

The Houshold of God are built upon the foundation of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> not upon their persons, but their doctrine. The doctrinall foundation is it, which the Church is built upon: Now, if the things written in Scripture be able to doe all things, to build us up, to save our souls; if it be the Word of truth on which we trust, and upon which the Church is built, &amp;c. Then it must needs be acknowledged the foundation of our Christian Religion. Now if they have a new Religion which is neither able to beget Faith, nor to save their souls; then I yeild indeed; that it is not grounded on Scripture, neither is it the Christian Religion: But if our Religion be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for these blessed ends &amp; effects; then it has the written word for its foundation, and is in truth the Religion of Christ.</p>

And how can we in charity think, that such persons doe seriously minde their own eternall good, that do so grosly slight the Word of Life? Remember that of Ps. 119.155. <hi>Salvation is far from the wicked:</hi> Why? <hi>For they seek not thy Statutes.</hi> 'Tis not I that tell you this, but <hi>David</hi> tells you so, yea, the Holy-Ghost tells you so, and

                  <p>But consider,<note place="margin">Motive.</note> that Salvation is the greatest thing, that one needfull thing, that a Christian hath to tend in this world: What is all your Wealth and Bravery?<note place="margin">Luke 10.42.</note> all your Mirth and Jollity? What is all, or any thing you have, if in the end you come short of Salvation? Your Salvation is the thing we aim at, and pray for, and preach for, and take paines to hold forth unto you the Word of Life. It is the end wherefore Christ dyed, and rose againe. The end wherefore with so much love, and such a miracle of mercies, he hath preserved unto you the Bible.</p>

How many Devils can be in one body; What <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preachments were, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:205094:43"/>how he was in the body or out of the body, and not knew it: And a multitude of such Questions, which serve to satisfie mens Curiosity, rather than edifie in the faith.</p>
                  <p>Others search the Scriptures to pervert them, not so much out of a desire to know and obey the Truth, as to Quarrell, and move doubts and Quirks to pervert the known received Truths of God. The Scriptures doe challenge in all mens mindes a Superlative commanding Authority: and every Sect would faine have the Scriptures to speake on their side: Now here's the fault, many doe first take up an opinion, and then afterwards seeke out Scripture to make it good; they bring an opinion to the Scriptures, whereas it should first arise, and be received from Scripture: And hence it is that the Scripture is wrested: Thus contentious and Hereticall wits doe search the Scriptures to make good what they have conceived in their own braines; and so the Scripture is made, as it were the Broker to set off Notions, which men have forged in their own Braines. Thus many opinionists search the Scriptures, doting about <hi>Questions,</hi> which <hi>gender strife,</hi> rather than edifying, and so are kept off from acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Christ all their dayes, even by Scripture it selfe mis-studied.</p>
                  <p>Others read Scriptures as a Taske for forme and fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake, as if the Chapter read or heard were all their duty: The truth is, There is no better taske, than constantly to read or heare the Scriptures. And most of us are negligent that way, every odde Trifling occasion diverts us from that duty: And unlesse we tye our selves to such tasks, we should hardly finde time to converse with God in his Word; It is a pious and Christian fashion in every family to keepe set times of prayer and reading of Scriptures. But if it be but a Taske it is naught, it proves but a meere <hi>bodily exercise,</hi> which a child may doe, as well as men of understanding.</p>
                  <p>Thus therefore remaines your duty in your study of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to study Christ, to know something that may procure or evidence your interest in Christ, to instruct you in the word of righteousnesse, to bring you neerer unto God, else you read, and search, and hear, and at last be far from eternall
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:205094:43"/>life, because unacquainted with Christ. Therefore propose to your selves such heads of knowledge, namely, to learne what Christ is in relation to his Father, in relation to his Church and People; what promises, what fulnesse, what me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, what riches of grace there is in him, what his Spirit is to us, and in us, what his Will is concerning us, and what our Duty is concerning him; Christ hath done all that a Christ should do for us, and we must do what Sinners ought to do in obedience to him.</p>
                  <p>And all this knowledge of him, must be first distinct and cleare, able to give an account of what we believe, and why we believe it: Secondly, and it must be a savory knowledge, seasoning the heart with the good knowledge of Christ, transforming us into his Image: even as by the taste of Wine and Honey, we know the sweetnesse and goodnesse of them experimentally, so the learning of Christ is not onely literall, but spirituall and operative, it doth expell out of the minde that naturall <hi>blindnesse,</hi> and <hi>hardnesse of heart,</hi> that <hi>senslesnesse,</hi> and <hi>searednesse</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>the naturall man is alienated from the life of God,</hi>

               <p>It is noted out of <hi>Socrates,</hi> l. 1 c 8. that <hi>Alexander,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the presence of his Clergy, discoursing too curiously of the mysterious Trinity and Unity, gave occasion to <hi>Arrius</hi> (who envied the Bishops honour) to think that he denied the Trinity of Persons (which was the error of <hi>Sabel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>) whereas the Bishop intended onely the Unity of Nature in the Godhead: Against this, <hi>Arrius</hi> drives so furiously, that to confute <hi>Sabellius,</hi> and in him, as (he thought) the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.

                     <hi>but hereafter face to face,</hi> sayes the Apostle; God did make known to Moses some Characters of the divine nature, whereby Moses might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, what a God he was, and this is called a <hi>proclaiming of the name of the Lord,</hi> because as men are known by their names one from another: so the Lord is known and discer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from all false Gods, and from all the creatures by these properties of his nature, which he proclaimed unto <hi>Moses.</hi> Exod. 34.5.6. <hi>And the Lord descended in the Cloud, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the name of the Lord; and the Lord passed before him, &amp; proclaimed the Lord, The Lord God gracious, and mercifull, long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth, keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression, and sinne, and that will by no meanes cleare the guilty.</hi> These are the name of God, whereby, as by a name, he is known from all other things, for none but God can assume those titles. <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious; and will shew mercy, on whom I will
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:205094:46"/>shew mercy. Moses</hi> desired to know <hi>Gods name,</hi> Exod. 3.14. And God said to <hi>Moses, I am that I am,</hi> that is, I am an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Beeing, who have my Beeing of my self: Thus God is known by his Essence, He is <hi>Jah,</hi> and <hi>Jehovah,</hi> that eternall Beeing; and by his properties and actions; this is by God himself expounded to be his back parts, that is, a knowledge that we have of him by his Word, revealing his Nature unto us; and it is opposed to the seeing of God <hi>face to face:</hi> The face and back-parts of God do but difference an obscure and weak knowledge of God from that full and pefect seeing of him in the life to come. Thus men use to speak and expresse themselves: thus we read; that the Scripture ascribes unto God,<note place="margin">Prov. 15.3. Psal. 10.14. Exek. 43.7.</note> hands, eyes, feet, as, <hi>His eyes are in every place behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the good and the evil. God will require it with his hand. The place of the soles of his feet is his sanctuary,</hi> &amp;c. In such speeches the Scripture humbleth it self to our capacities. Such expressions doe signifie the like actions in God, done with hands, as men perform by their hands, eyes, and feet, that is, God seeth all our wayes, God is strong to revenge all wrongs, to perform all his promises and judgements, without hands or eyes, as men do the like actions by their hands and eyes.</p>
                  <p>Againe, we read that the Scripture does ascribe unto God humane passions, as of Joy, Grief, Anger, Wrath, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, &amp;c. We may not thinke that God is subject to like passions, as a man is; when the Priest of <hi>Jupiter</hi> would have done Sacrifice to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> supposing they had been Gods in humane shape, the Apostle reproves their folly,<note place="margin">Acts 24.15.</note> saying unto them, <hi>Sirs, why doe ye these things, we are not Gods, we are men of like passions with you:</hi> So that God is differenced from a man, because he is not of like passions with men. But such expressions you must understand to be spoken after the manner of men; for by such manner of speeches, we understand the nature of God, (namely that he hates all sin, that he delights in uprightness.) As men doe shew their dislike of a thing by anger, by grieving, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, by punishing, by changing their minds, &amp;c. So the Scripture does by the like things set forth Gods displeasure
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:205094:46"/>against sin, and the evill wayes of mankinde, so for Joy and delight, &amp;c. These things being attributed to God, doe shew that God is well pleased with the wayes of righteousnesse and holinesse, as men are well pleased with those things, wherein they take Joy and delight.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, in this like manner doe we speake unto God in prayer, when we say, <hi>O Lord, Turne from thy fierce anger,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb 14.14, 16, 18.</note>
                     <hi>let it repent thee of the evill; let he Lord delight in us to doe us good, &amp;c.</hi> our speech is according to our conceit of things, and by such speeches to God, we shew, not what God is in himselfe (subject to changes, &amp;c.) But what a one we would have him towards us, and what to doe for us.</p>
                  <p>Through want of this distinction, many have grosse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of the divine Nature; First, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>1</label> some have grosse conceits of God in their mindes, as if he were like unto man, or might be worshipped with mens hands, or as if he did dwell in Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples made with hands, or were confined to this or that place for worship, to this or that picture, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Others make a quite contrary use of it; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> To what end (say they) is your fasting and weeping, your prayers and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, doe you thinke that God changeth his mind? No, but yet we thinke, that God shewes what a one he will be to an humble, praying, repenting people by taking to himself such names and affections as be in men; And by them we may comfortably gather, that God will be good to us in such wayes, because as men are mercifull and good to them, that be sorry for their offences, and humble themselves, and seek their favour: so is God to us. The reason is, because these good things which are qualities in us, are nature in God: He is just, holy, and good by nature. <hi>In essentia divinâ, nec aliud nec Accidens,</hi> the simplicity and purenesse of his nature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no mixtures or compositions, either of substance with his substance, or of accidents added to his substance; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is said in the Abstract, God is <hi>love,</hi> God is <hi>light:</hi> Now if we that are partakers of the divine Nature can shew forth mercy and goodnesse, Truth and kindnesse, much more God, whose Nature it is; He will be such a God to us.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>I conceive that the intent of that senceless Error, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Person</hi> in the Deity, and to deny the Trinity of Persons, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Error. </seg>3</label> in the Unity of Essence, as by their third Error doth expressely appeare, which saith; <hi>That it is a wretched distinction to distinguish betwixt Essence and Person:</hi> There being such an Affinity betweene these two Errors; The same Arguments will serve to confute both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Against both which I lay down these two conclusions. First, that in Scripture the name of <hi>God</hi> is sometimes taken <hi>Essentially,</hi> and sometime <hi>Personally:</hi> Essentially, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.4. <hi>Heare O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord.</hi> God is but one Beeing, and none is, besides him; so <hi>Isa.</hi> 45.5.6. <hi>I am the Lord, and there is none else, There is no God besides me;</hi> which places and expressions doe notifie unto us, the whole God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head as he is opposed to false Gods, and unto creatures; when God is set against creatures, or mentioned with other things, that are not God, then the word is taken <hi>Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes it is taken <hi>personally,</hi> to signifie any one of the Persons in the Trinity: And so it is taken when any Person is named with another, as <hi>Ioh</hi> 1.1. <hi>The Word was with God, and the Word was God,</hi> (that is) Jesus Christ the Word and Son of God, was with God the Father: so in that Apostolicall Benediction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the holy Ghost, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here all three persons be named, and the love of <hi>God</hi> is
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:205094:47"/>there taken personally, for the love of God the Father; by which it appeares, that to take God otherwise than personal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, is not to mistake him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Against their third Error I lay downe this Conclusion,<note place="margin">The doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ine of the Trinity in Unity.</note> namely, there be three Persons in one individuall nature of the Deity.</p>
                  <p>The Scripture teacheth us to distinguish between <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> or betweene the divine <hi>Nature</hi> and the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> that partake of that Nature. The Godhead is to be considered in the <hi>Ʋnity</hi> of his <hi>Nature,</hi> and in the <hi>Trinity</hi> of <hi>Persons;</hi> the same divine Nature is communicated to three Persons, the Father is God, the Sonne is God, and the holy Ghost God; yet the Persons be not so divided, as to make three Gods, nor the Nature so one, as to deny the three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. There is but one God in Beeing, whose name is <hi>I am,</hi> Exod. 3.14. This cannot be denied, to note God in Essence, for it is the proper meaning of that name: And this one God in Essence is three Persons, Father, Son and holy Ghost: we must acknowledge three distinct Persons subsisting in the Unity of the Godhead: <hi>Matthew</hi> 28.19. <hi>Goe teach and ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptise them in the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> Here three are joyned together, to whom equally we performe worship, and promise our obedience, and of whom we expect remission of Sins, and everlasting Salvation. Hence our Argument is thus framed, into whose name we are baptized, He is the most high God (for we must not be baptized into the name of <hi>Paul,</hi> or <hi>Apollos,</hi> or any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whatsoever) but we are baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and holy Ghost: therefore the Father, Son, and holy Ghost are that one, eternall, most high God, who alone is to be worshipped, and who alone is able to forgive our Sins, and save our Souls.</p>
                  <p>This is necessary to the true knowledge of God, and after this manner God hath revealed himself in Scripture. And he that does not acknowledge it, does not know God as he ought, neither can he worship him aright. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to helpe your Understandings in this great mysterie; I will shew first what a <hi>Person</hi> in the Deity is,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:205094:48"/>Secondly, and give farther proofes of my second conclusion.</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">What a Person in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head is.</note> by <hi>Person</hi> we doe not mean a multiplication of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in particular, that subsist apart, having in them the self-same generall Nature; (as for example) <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> do, who are humane persons, under the species of man, subsist a part, and separate one from another. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in the God-head are not so, they are not three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Substances, to whom one generall Nature is common; for then there would be three particular Gods, as <hi>James, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> are three singular Men, but three that sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by one Substance, which it self is particular, yet they all Three have it, and their severall wayes of having it, are that which maketh their personall distinction:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eccles. Polit.</hi> lib. 5. sect 51.</note> Take it in the words of judicious <hi>Hooker,</hi>
                     <q>The Lord our God is but one God, in which indivisible Unity, we adore the Father, as altogether of himselfe, we glorifie that Consubstantial Word, which is the Sonne; we blesse and magnifie that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>essentiall Spirit, eternally proceeding from both, which is the holy Ghost: Seeing therefore the Father is of none, the Sonne is of the Father, and the Spirit is of both, they are by these their several properties really distinguishable each from other: for the substance of God, with this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty to be of none, doth make the Person of the Father the very self-same substance in number with this property, to be of the Father maketh the Person of the Son; the very same substance having this property of proceeding from the other two, maketh the Person of the holy-Ghost; So that in every Person there is implied both the substance of God, which is one, and also that property, which causeth the same Person really and truly to differ from the other two: Every Person hath his owne subsistence, which no other besides hath, although there be others besides that are of the same substance.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Qu. <hi>What is a Person in the Trinity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> It is whole God, not absolutely considered, but by way of some personall properties; It is a manner of Beeing in the Godhead, or a distinct subsistence, not a quality, having the whole Godhead in it. <hi>Ʋsher</hi> p. 78.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:205094:48"/>
                  <p>To this so cleere and safe an expression of so incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible a mystery, I shall not presume to adde more words; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I wish the use of <hi>Athanasius</hi> Creed were restored to the Church, and well understood of all the people.</p>
                  <p>Obj. <hi>O! but we doe not read in Scripture, that the Father, Son, and holy Ghost are called three Persons in the Godhead; the terme</hi> Person <hi>is not fit to be used, because it implieth three par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular substances, existing severally, and apart, which cannot agree to the Deity, which is but one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> It may be so indeed in your corrupt imagination onely; if you will measure the Beeing and subsisting of God by rules of Logick, and humane Reason then you cannot conceive a Unity in a Trinity, how One should be three Persons, and not three divided or severed Substances. Howbeit, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of a divine Person now given, you see clearely how <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Person</hi> are distinguished according to the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Scripture; yea the Scripture useth not onely words which signifie as much as we mean by <hi>Person;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The word <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> used in Scripture.</note> but the very word <hi>[Person]</hi> it self, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. where Christ is called <hi>the expresse Image of Gods Person,</hi> he is called <hi>the brightnesse of his Fathers glory,</hi> I say, his Fathers glory; for the Apostle speakes of the Sonne in all this Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 2.5. because as the Father is glorious, so is Christ his Sonne glorious with the same glory, <hi>John</hi> 17.5. <hi>Father, glorifie thou me with thine owne selfe, with the glory which I had with thee before the World was.</hi> What glory was that? Not a created glory (for there was nothing created before the beginning of the world) it must needs be an uncreated glory; so he is called <hi>the Lord of glory,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.8. Again, he is called <hi>the expresse Image of his Fathers person,</hi> if the Father be a Person, then so is the Sonne, and so is the holy-Ghost, (there being Three named to be God) look by what name one of them is distinguished, by the same, doubtlesse, the others are distinguished; he does not say Christ is the Image of his Nature, but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, of his personall subsistence; why then there is one Person of the Father, and another of the Sonne; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is one Person, the Sonne is another Person of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, having his owne proper subsistence, as the Father hath;
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:205094:49"/>even as the Signets impression doth answer all the lineaments and proportion of the Seale, and as the letters and words printed upon paper are the Character, and doe answer to the image of the Types, or the letters set by the Printer. So here is one person answering to another: Angels and holy men are the image of Gods holinesse, but not of his Person: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be the expresse image of Gods person, but he that is a divine person; for Personallity is the thing, wherein they are alike, and resemble each other.</p>
                  <p>Now I proceed to give you further proofes of my second conclusion,<note place="margin">The doctrine of the Trinity proved.</note> (namely) that there be three Persons in one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall Nature of the Deity; you have seene this proved by the institution of our. Baptism, see the same Truth confirmed at the Baptizing of Christ, where are three distinct Persons, and names,<note place="margin">John 1.32. Luke 3.22.</note> and personall actions, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.16, 17. First, there is <hi>Christ</hi> the party Baptized coming out of the water: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, there is the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> descending like a <hi>Dove,</hi> and abiding on him: <hi>(non levi tantùm motu, sed corporali specie:)</hi> Thirdly, there is <hi>God the Father</hi> testifying of Christ by a voice from heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet 1.17.</note> Here's the Person of the Father, and the Person of the Son; and of the Spirit of God in a bodily shape, which abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a bodily shape is a personall Action. These three Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons are of the same Dignity and Authority as appeares by that Apostolicall Benediction, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.14. <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost be with you:</hi> Here be three sorts of mercies wished and prayed for, from three distinct Persons, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring joyntly to the Churches Salvation; The which, as they cannot be given from any Creatures so neither may they be prayed for, from any that is not God; To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it is worth your observing, by what kind of Argument the Apostle does perswade the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto unity, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.4, 5, 6. It is taken from the unity of that God, from whom all their gifts did proceed. <hi>There are diversities of Gifts, but the same Spirit</hi> (the Spirit in that place is not a Gift, but a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son bestowing gifts.) <hi>And there are differences of administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the same Lord; and there are diversities of operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:205094:49"/>but it is the same God which worketh all in all:</hi> The force of <hi>Paul</hi>'s reasoning is this; All, whatsoever ye have, whether gifts, or ministrations, or miraculous operations, they do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one God, but those mentioned in the Text, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed partly from the holy Spirit, partly from the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, partly from God the Father; therefore Father, Son and holy Ghost are that one God, in whom ye ought to be at uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because the Bestowers of all your severall gifts are one. But let S. <hi>John</hi> conclude this point, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that beare record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost, and these Three are One.</hi> How One? By consent and agreement: so the holy Angels and good Men are One, and so the <hi>Witnesses on Earth,</hi> ver. 8. are One, <hi>the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood,</hi> these Three agree in One, as if the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle did purposely intend to note a difference between the Unity of Essence, and the Unity of Consents, (he saith, <hi>signan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) the Witnesses in Heaven are One, the Witnesses on Earth are not One,</hi> onely they <hi>agree in One</hi> From all which places laid together, I conclude, that to distinguish between <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> is an holy truth of God, and one of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Christian Faith &amp; Religion: And it is the Blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of an Hereticall Braine, wretchedly subverted and turned from the Truth, to affirme, that to distinguish between <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> is a wretched distinction.</p>
                  <p>Touching the manner how the Son is begotten of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how, or in what manner the holy Ghost proceeds from them both, seeing it is not expressed in Scripture; it shall suffice us to give glory to God, and believe it, because he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it, rather than search curiously into that which is not revealed;<note place="margin">Psal 13.9.14, 15.

                     <hi>to the obtaining of the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.</hi> So that as it was said in the Creation, <hi>Let us make man,</hi> so now it may be said; <hi>Let us redeeme lost man,</hi> all joyning in the decree, and in the meanes of bringing the elect unto life: As man is said to believe with the whole heart, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faculties of the soul concurr in embracing of Christ, the mind to conceive, the will to consent, the heart to trust, &amp;c. So in this businesse the Lord our Maker is our Redeemer: The Unity of their Nature doth teach us not to divide them in our mindes, when we worship God; And the distinction of their persons doth teach us, not to confound their order of working.</p>
                  <p>In this doctrine we see the reason, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>2</label> why some things are ascribed to the whole Trinity: (namely) because they all partake of one and the same divine Nature, and some things againe are peculiar and proper to each person by himselfe. First, some Properties and Actions belong alike to all three;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:205094:50"/>as to be Almighty, Gracious, Just, Holy, and Good, to be co-equal; <hi>the Son thought it no Robbery to be equall with the Father.</hi> To be co-eternal and of the same time; <hi>Christ</hi> (as <hi>God</hi>) was begotten from all eternity: so he himselfe saith in the name of <hi>Wisdome,</hi> in these words, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.24, 25. <hi>When there was no depths, then was I begotten, or brought forth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mountaines or hills were setled, was I brought forth,</hi> and therefore <hi>Isaiah</hi> Cha. 9.6. calleth the Son, <hi>the everlasting Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> To be equall in Majesty, honour, and worship; <hi>For all men must honour the Sonne, even as they honour the Father,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 5.13.</note>
                     <hi>he that honoureth not the Sonne, honoureth not the Father,</hi> Joh. 5.23. <hi>As the Father hath life in himselfe, so he hath given to the Son to have life in himselfe,</hi> ver 25. — Lastly by reason of the Unity of the God-head, they have all one will; what the Father willeth, the same also doth the Son, and the holy Ghost will, without crossing or varying one from another; Christ saith, <hi>Father I will, that they whom thou hast given me, be with me, where I am,</hi> Joh. 17.24. <hi>And this is the will of the Father, that of all which he hath given me, I should lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi> Joh. 6.39. The holy Ghost willeth the same, for <hi>he shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you, all things that the Father hath are mine, therefore said I, that he shall take of mine (for he is sent from the Father.)</hi> Joh. 16.14, 15.</p>
                  <p>Here Christ sheweth the Unity of Essence in the holy Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the community of Power, Wisdome, Sanctity, Truth, Glory, and Majesty; It is an ancient Rule among Divines, <hi>opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa;</hi> All three Persons concurr in the actions, which are terminated in the creatures, they proceed from the same will in them all, as to Decree, to Create, to Governe, to Sanctifie, according as it is said, <hi>Job</hi> 35.10. <hi>Where is God thy Makers,</hi> in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; so <hi>Isaiah</hi> 54.5. <hi>Thy maker is thy husband,</hi> in the Hebrew it is <hi>Conjuges tui, Factores tui,</hi> thy makers is thine husbands, which notes a plurality of Persons in one and the same Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Iunius</hi> applyes it to the holy Trinity.</p>
                  <p>Yet there are some properties peculiar and proper to each person by himselfe, which are not communicable to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, the Father begets, the Son is begotten, the holy
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:205094:51"/>Ghost proceeds. And as there is an order of subsisting, so also of working, the Father worketh all things of himselfe (as the Originall and Fountaine of Action) in the Son, and by the holy Ghost; The Sonne worketh from and with the Father, <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made, that was made.</hi> The holy Ghost worketh from them both; for <hi>he shall take of mine,</hi> (saith Christ) the Sonne worketh from the Father by the holy Ghost; the holy Ghost worketh from them both, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. <hi>The Comforter, which is the holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things:</hi> and John 15.26. It is said, that <hi>the Comforter, whom I will send unto you from the Father, even the Spirit of Truth, which proceedeth from the Father.</hi> Now this order of working is also peculiar unto each person, they change not places. And among these peculiar works this is one, that the Sonne onely took flesh, and suffered for mans transgressions, and not the Father, nor the holy Ghost, as is falsly affirmed in their fourth Error, of which in the next place.</p>

                  <p>THis wretched Assertion is contrary to plain places of Scripture, which expresly teach, that the Son onely took Flesh, and suffered for the transgressions of Man, and not the Father, nor the Holy Ghost, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>The Word was made Flesh,</hi> (that is) Jesus Christ the eternall,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.3.</note> and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall Word of God, which <hi>was in the beginning with God, and was God, by whom all things were made,</hi> John 1.1, 3. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4, 5. <hi>But when the fulnesse of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this place are plainly distinguished; First,<note place="margin">The second Person onely took our flesh to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for us.</note> the Person sending, <hi>God the Father;</hi> and the Person sent, his <hi>Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Ye have the Incarnation of the Son onely; his Son was <hi>made of a Woman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That the Son onely suffered for our transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; for <hi>He was made under the Law to redeem us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The end why he sent his Son to take Flesh, and to suffer for us, was to <hi>make us Sons.</hi> Adde hereunto, that as the Father sent the Son, so his Incarnation was by the power of the Holy Ghost. <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. <hi>The Holy Ghost shall come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is impious therefore, to affirm, that either the Father or the Holy Ghost were incarnate, or that they suffered for the transgressing Creatures. The Apostle saith expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that <hi>Jesus was delivered for our offences, and raised
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:205094:52"/>againe for our Justification,</hi> Rom. 4.25. and Rom. 5.10. <hi>while we were enemies, we were reconciled unto God by the death of his Sonne: It is Christ</hi> therefore, <hi>that died, Rom.</hi> 8 34. not the Father, nor the Holy Ghost: It is Jesus Christ to whom this properly does belong, that he <hi>washed us from our sinnes, in his owne blood, Rev.</hi> 1.5. Then as the Father and the holy Ghost did not take flesh; so neither did they die nor suffer for our sinnes. It is true indeed, that the Sonne and the holy Ghost have the selfe same uncreated Essence or substance in themselves, as well as the Father, (otherwise they should have had no true God-head) yet this hindreth not the incarnation of one person, without the incarnation of the other two. The essence or Nature of God, by reason of its infinite simplicity, cannot be divided into parts, yet seeing it is after one manner in the Father,<note place="margin">

                  <p>O Horrid Blasphemy! Is this a comfort for Believers? Is it not the ready way to seale up unto them their Damnation, through the hardnesse and impenitency of their hearts? For how can they repent, that impute their sins not to themselves for their humiliation and amendment, but unto God as the Author of them? We Sinners should lay our sins upon <hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 9.28.</note> as our sacrifice, who was <hi>offered to beare the sins of many;</hi> but to impute them unto God, as the Author of them, is an abominable Blasphemy.</p>
                  <p>For proof, consider these places of Scripture, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5. <hi>God is Light,</hi> a pure, perfect light, <hi>and in him is no darknesse at all:</hi> there is not the least mixture of any evill in him, as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:205094:53"/>the Psalmist speaks; <hi>Psal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness, neither shall any evil dwell with thee.</hi> God cannot be defiled with evill from others, God cannot be tempted with evill, no evill can dwell with him, neither does God, who is nothing but light, defile any man, nay, he hath no hand in the sins of men, for <hi>he tempteth no man,</hi> James 1.13. If God do not so much as tempt unto sin,<note place="margin">God is no way the Author of sin.</note> then much lesse is he the Author of their sins, either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilling into man any evill, or by commanding or forcing him to sin, or causing him to act irregularly, wickedly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holily.</p>
                  <p>For it is against, and inconsistent with the nature of God, if God hath an hand in mens sinfulnesse, as much, or more, than they themselves, then he is a sinner, as they are; and so he should not be God; we have so much to do in our own sinfulnesse, that it does truly make us sinners: and if God have more hand in our very sinfulnesse, then he is a greater sinner than we are, and so he should cease to be God; for God is holy and good, yea, so transcendently good,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 2.2.</note> that none is good but God, <hi>None is holy as the Lord, there is none be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides him.

But if God were the Author of mans sinfulnesse, he would like his own work. There need not be such a dread in man, by reason of his uncleannesse, yea, if he had so great an hand in mans sinfulnesse as they themselves, then he should delight in evill, for so does man. God doth hate, forbid, threaten, and punish all sin, therefore he cannot be Author of any sin, <hi>Zechariah</hi> 8.17. <hi>Let no man imagine evill in his heart against his Neighbour, and love no false Oath, for all these are things that I hate, saith the Lord;</hi> And he taketh vengeance on them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>for the wrath of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed

The positive Act, whereunto sinne cleaveth, is of God in the same sort, that all other Actions of the creatures are; but the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity of the creatures Actings, are to be ascribed to their owne proper cause (namely) the devill and the corrupt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man. And of the actions of the creatures are those sayings of Schoole-men to be understood, (namely) <hi>that no second cause can move without the agency of the first.</hi> And <hi>the first cause runs into the effect of the second causes, All creatures worke in the power of God.</hi> This is meant of mans created Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and Actions, not of the crookednesse and Pravity of his Actions, which have not God for their maker.

                  <p>Thirdly, though God doe not make sinne, yet he willingly <hi>permitteth</hi> the sinnes of mankinde, But his permissive will is not the cause of any mans sinne; There is no evill in the world, which God knoweth not of, or whether God will or no, for that were to deny his omnipotency, God did permit &amp; suffer <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, (that is) God did not hinder it by his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent Power, nor by his extraordinary Grace.

Deut. 27.26.</note> The first entrance of sinne into the world, and the continuance of it in the world, was by the voluntary action of mans will corrupting it selfe; God permitted the fall of man not by instilling into him any evill,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.13.</note> nor by taking from him any ability unto good, but by suffering Satan to tempt him, and leaving man to the Liberty and Mutability of his owne will, who sinned freely with a whole and intire will, and hearkened to the voice of the Serpent, more than to the voice of his God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> If then any Ask, <hi>What God has to doe about, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning sin?</hi> It is reduced to three actions:</p>

                        <hi>White</hi>'s way, p. 273.</note> he sustains mankind, and upholds his Beeing in all its powers and faculties: <hi>My father worketh hitherto,</hi> he upholds the worke of his Creation, and governes them all.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">The particular Doctrine tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Gods dealing in and about sin.</note> he leaves the sinner to himselfe, to his owne wit and strength, to his owne lusts, Counsells, and Temptations, he withholds his Grace being bound to no man, whereupon it follows, That their hearts harden, &amp; the bent of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inclinations leads them to severall sins, according to the variety of objects, which are set before them, and of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereunto they are exposed, and so they are carried unto severall sinnes, even as they are led. As a water-course runs downward by its owne weight, when the damme, that pent it up is removed. Thus God is said (<hi>Joh.</hi> 12.40.) to <hi>blind their eyes,</hi> and <hi>harden their hearts,</hi> not by creating Sinne in them, as he doth Grace in the elect; but by withholding the influences and supplyes of his Grace, which should soften them, and by offering them sundry objects, which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert unto occasions of sinne, and they have no will to doe otherwise.<note place="margin">Rom 9.19.</note> He hardeneth by not shewing mercy, as in the Winter by the absence of the Sun, the naturall coldnesse of the aire and earth doe cause Frost and Ice.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God ordereth and governeth the wicked actions of men, to bring to passe certain good effects, which the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner never intended, nor could they flow from the nature of those evill actions; but God over-ruleth all the evil actions of the Creatures, sometimes to punish a faithlesse and stubborn Generation; sometimes for the glory of his Justice
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:205094:56"/>in the shame and punishment of the sinner himself, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to manifest his glory, mercy, and goodnesse towards his Church and People, so as their sufferings are turned to their comfort, so that God is not onely a bare permitter of evill works, but a powerfull Governor of them to his glory. Thus <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s Brethren sent him into <hi>Egypt</hi> out of envy, but God sent him to provide for his Church, and to bring him to that honour, which was foretold in his Dream, that his Brethrens sheafs should bow down before <hi>Ioseph</hi>'s. Thus <hi>Shemei</hi> did curse <hi>David,</hi> he did it to drive <hi>David</hi> to despair, but God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected it to humble him: And <hi>God</hi> is said to <hi>bid Shemei curse him,</hi> because he gave him an occasion to vent his malice against the house of <hi>David:</hi> like as a Chyrurgion, with his Lance, opens the Wounds, and lets out the Corruption that was in the Bile before.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Pilate, Judas,</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> had all of them an hand in crucifying of Christ: <hi>Pilate,</hi> to please the People, and to keep his credit with <hi>Caesar; Judas,</hi> for lucre of the Money; and the <hi>Jewes,</hi> that our Saviour Christ should not reign over them. These all did their own work, they drave on their own designs; And God did his work by them (namely) to save many souls alive. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23. c. 4.28.</p>
                  <p>By this which hath been said, you may see a reason why, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>1</label> When God and Man are declared to meet in one and the same action (as in <hi>Joseph</hi>'s sending into <hi>Egypt,</hi> &amp;c.) Man is guilty and justly condemned, &amp; God remains without all stain of sin, and doth justly punish the sinner (namely) because <hi>in unâ &amp; eâdem re, quam fecerunt, non est eadem causa ob quam fecerunt.</hi> The cause from whence the action cometh, is not the same in God, and in the Sinner. <hi>Joseph</hi>'s Brethren sold him into <hi>Egypt</hi> out of Eny, God sent him thither in Mercy; <hi>Judas</hi> sold his Master out of Covetousnesse, and the Jewes of Envy, but God gave Christ of his meere Love: In brief, Men do their own work and wills, they intend not to obey God in their sinfull doings; God doth over-rule them to his glory, and the Churches good: As a Physician lets blood by Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, the Leeches do but their kind, which is to suck blood, they intend not the good of the sick party, or any service to
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:205094:57"/>the Physician: Howbeit the Physician ordereth by his skill the naturall quality of that worm, unto that, which by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it could not do, (namely) the health of the Patient: So doth the Lord bring his work to passe by the hands of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men; they ignorantly, and against their wills, serve the Providence of God, even when they rebell against him: And for this it is, that such men are justly damned, though Gods Providence be thereby served, because they fulfilled their own lusts, and if good be brought out of such actions, it is no thanks to them: <hi>The Son of Man goeth, as it is written of him, But woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed:</hi> Gods purpose was by that means fulfilled, yet <hi>Judas</hi> is dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his pains.</p>
                  <p>From this difference between the <hi>commanding</hi> will of God, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving</hi> will is the onely rule of our actions, and in the doing of it alone, may men take comfort: we cannot justifie our selves, or others, in things done against Gods revealed will, though it comes to passe not quite without his providentiall permissive will; let no man beare himself out upon this Principle, That it was the will of God it should be thus and thus, else it could never have come to passe, because nothing comes to passe whether God will or no; yet, wo to that man that shall do evil upon that account, his damnation is just: 'Twas Gods will to suffer <hi>Abel</hi> to be killed, yet woe to <hi>Caine</hi> that slew him, <hi>Thy Brothers blood cryeth:</hi> 'Twas Gods will that Christ should be put to death, yet they were <hi>Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers</hi> that did it, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.23.

                  <p>The reason is, because such persons cannot say, God is with us to approve us; they cannot say, We are workers together with God, God did set us on work: such persons are under Gods permissive will, which has for its end his own glory in the World's just punishment, not the good of the parties instrumentall.

                  <p>Against all which, I oppose, as an undoubted truth, that this Doctrine, (namely) That Christ the Son of God, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> is true God, equall, and of the same Nature, Power, and Eternity with the Father, far above all created Natures, God blessed for ever.</p>
                  <p>This is confirmed by many evident testimonies of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>First, He is in Scripture expresly called God, <hi>Jehovah, the moct high God,</hi> Isa. 9.6. <hi>Ʋnto us a Son is given, his name shall be called Wonderfull, the mighty God;</hi> The Child that was borne, the Son that was given, is <hi>the mighty God, the everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting Father.</hi> The Jewes charged Christ with Blasphemy, because he said, <hi>that God was his Father, making himself equall with God,</hi> John 5.18. <hi>And because that thou being a Man, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest thy selfe God,</hi> John 10.3. The force of their reason is this, that the naturall Son of God is God, equall with God, as the naturall Son of a Man is Man, equall,<note place="margin">Mat. 16.16.</note> and of the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:205094:59"/>with his Father. So <hi>Isa.</hi> 7.8. The Virgins Son is called <hi>Immanuel,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 1.23.</note> (which being interpreted) is, <hi>God with us.</hi> God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of his Father from all Eternity, and with us by taking our flesh of the Virgin. Christ is called GOD properly, and absolutely in his Nature by the Apostle. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>That same Christ which came of the Father, as concerning the Flesh, he is over all, God blessed for ever.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle there doth distinguish in Christ two Natures, God and Man, and as truly as he is man of the seed of <hi>David,</hi> so truly he is God over all blessed for ever. Again, it is said, that <hi>Christ Jesas being in the form of God, thought it no robbery to be equall with God,</hi> Phil. 2.6. If he were but a Man, it were robbery in the highest decree to make himself equall with God. God is wronged and robbed of his Majesty and Glory, when any Creature shall make himself Gods equall. Lastly,<note place="margin">Col. 2.9.</note>
                     <hi>In Christ dwells all the fulnesse of the Godhead bodily,</hi> that is, personally in the flesh of Christ; he does not say (as one well observes) <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Deitatis,</hi> the Godhead it self, and therefore he is <hi>Deus summus,</hi> the most high God. Of those places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, this is the summe and substance. Jesus Christ the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins Son, is the mighty God, the Son of God, equal with God, God with us, God over all, not a petty-God, but God over all,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.16.</note> who thought it no robbery to be equall with God, <hi>God manifest in the Flesh,</hi> yea, all the fulnesse of the Godhead dwels in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Our Divines prove the Son to be true God by comparing the Old Test, with the New; for what the Old Testament speaks of <hi>Jehovah,</hi> which is God, the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment applies to <hi>Christ:</hi> As for example, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.5. <hi>The people spake against God, and against Moses,</hi> with Psal. 95.9. <hi>O come let us worship, and kneel before the Lord our maker, for he is our God,</hi> ver. 6, 7. <hi>Your Father,</hi> saith God, <hi>tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty yeares.</hi> This <hi>Paul</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth to <hi>Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 10 9. <hi>Neither let us tempt Christ as some of them tempted, and were destroyed of Serpents,</hi> Numb. 21.6. Therefore <hi>Christ</hi> is <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Again, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.6. God the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:205094:59"/>Father speaketh to God the Son, thus, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever:</hi> This is applied to Christ, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8 Unto the Son he saith, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for ever and ever, a Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of Righteousnesse is the Scepter of thy Kingdome.</hi> Againe, <hi>Isaiah</hi> saith, <hi>cap.</hi> 41.4. <hi>I the Lord am the first, and with the last I am he.</hi> This is also applied to <hi>Christ,</hi> Rev. 1.17.<note place="margin">Rev. 21.6.</note>
                     <hi>Feare not, I am the first and the last.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, In <hi>Isaiah</hi> 6.1. The Lord is presented to the Prophet in great majesty: <hi>I saw the Lord sitting upon a Throne, high, and lifted up,</hi> &amp;c. This is applied to <hi>Christ,</hi> John 12.41. <hi>These things,</hi> said Isaiah, <hi>when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</hi> Now what things were they that <hi>Isaiah</hi> then said? See <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.9, 10. He said, <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, and their eares heavy, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. These very words are repeated by S. <hi>John,</hi> cap. 12.39, 40. and applied to Christs obstinate, unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving hearers, <hi>They could not believe, because</hi> Isaiah <hi>said, he hath blinded their eyes, and hardned their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, When did <hi>Isaiah</hi> say these things? When he saw his glory, and spake of him, (that is) Christ the Lord of glory.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Christs works are the works of a God, none could do them, but he that is God.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made:</hi> John 1.3.<note place="margin">Col. 1.15, 16. Heb. 1.13.</note>
                     <hi>He made the World,</hi> and he <hi>supports</hi> the World, He <hi>upholds all things</hi> by the <hi>word</hi> of his <hi>power.</hi> He that made the World is God: so saith the Apostle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.4. <hi>Every house is builded by some man, but he that built all things is God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, He forgives sins; <hi>Who can forgive sins but God onely?</hi> Yet so doth Christ, therefore he is <hi>God,</hi> Mark 2.7, 9, 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He understood the thoughts of men. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.8. <hi>Iesus perceived in his spirit, that they so reasoned within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, He said unto them, Why reason you these things in your hearts?</hi> It seemes they uttered not their thoughts, yet Christ knew them. And when the Scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on the Sabbath day, it is said,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:205094:60"/>that <hi>he knew their thoughts Luke.</hi> 6.8. It is the Property of God alone to know and search the heart; <hi>The heart of man is deceitfull above all things, who can know it? I the Lord search the heart, I try the reines, even to give to every man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wayes, Jer.</hi> 17.10. Therefore Christ is very God, for <hi>all the Churches shall know</hi> (saith he <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23.) <hi>that I am he which searcheth the reines and hearts, and I will give to every one of you according to your works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, he giveth the holy Ghost, which none can doe but God,<note place="margin">Acts 2.33.</note>
                     <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. <hi>I will send the Comforter unto you from my Father; when he ascended up on high he led Captivity Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and gave gifts unto men, even the Gift of the holy Ghost, Acts.</hi> 1.8. with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.39.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, what should I speak of his miraculous works, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by his own Power,<note place="margin">Mark 9.18.</note> Word and Will: He <hi>raised the dead,</hi> commanded the <hi>devills to come forth</hi> of them that were <hi>possessed;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.4.</note> At his word the <hi>winde</hi> and the <hi>Seas</hi> are <hi>calme,</hi> they <hi>obey</hi> him: He did this by his owne Power. Yea, he giveth this power unto others, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. They shall <hi>cast out Devils,</hi> they shall <hi>speak with new tongues,</hi> they shall <hi>take up Serpents,</hi> and if they <hi>drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them,</hi> &amp;c. Men receive the gift of miracles from God, but no man can bestow it upon others.</p>
                  <p>These are the works of Christ, of which we may say as himself doth. <hi>John</hi> 15.24. <hi>I have done among them the works which none other man did:</hi> For can any but God create the World? Forgive Sins? Search and try the Hearts? Give the Holy Ghost? Work Miracles by his owne will and word? Christ doth all this, therefore he is the Almighty God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Christ is worshipped as God, and that by the Commandement of the Father.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.10. 1 Pet. 3.22. Acts 7.59.</note>
                     <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. <hi>When he bringeth in the first begotten into the World, he saith, Let all the Angels of God worship him:</hi> How great is he, to whom the Angels must perform worship and service?<note place="margin">John 20.28.</note>
                     <hi>Thomas</hi> the Apostle doth adore him, saying unto him, <hi>My Lord and my God.</hi> And they are blessed that do in like manner acknowledge him for their Lord and their God. Now God doth not communicate his
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:205094:60"/>worship to any, to whom he doth not communicate his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. <hi>My glory will I not give to another, Isa.</hi> 42.8. No crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is capable of worship, because it cannot be God. <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serve,</hi> said Christ to the Devil, <hi>Mat</hi> 4.10. The Angel that was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to shew S. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Revelation,</hi> refused to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, saying, <hi>See thou do it not, I am thy fellow-servant, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God,</hi> Rev. 22.8. Christ is worshipped as God, therefore he is very and true God.</p>
                  <p>Much more might be said to this purpose; but this is enough to make you detest and abhorre those forementioned Lies and Blasphemies, (namely) that Christ is a Mighty God, not Almighty, that there is but a graduall difference between Him, and <hi>Moses,</hi> and Us, and that he is not equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>For if he be God, then he must needs be Almighty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is not weak; and seeing he is God, he must needs be equall with God the Father, for in the Unity of Essence there can be no inequality.</p>

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:205094:61"/>Christ, two Natures, Flesh and God-head; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.3, 4. <hi>Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of</hi> David, <hi>according to the Flesh, and declared to be the Son of God, with power according to the Spirit of Holinesse,</hi> (that is, according to his Divine Nature.)

Yes, He is also <hi>God over all blessed for ever.</hi> Christ according to the Flesh is the Son of <hi>David,</hi> but according to the Spirit of Power, He is the Son of God; He is of the Jewes in one respect; He is not of the Jewes, but God over them, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother respect. Note how punctually the Scripture doth distinguish between the Person <hi>assuming,</hi> and the Nature <hi>assumed,</hi> Heb. 2.16. <hi>He took not on him the Nature of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells, but he took on him the seed of Abraham.</hi> The Son of God remaining God, took on him the seed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> He saved what he took, He saved not the Angells that fell, because he took not their Nature; So <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. <hi>He being equall with God, took upon him the forme of a Servant, and was made in the likenesse of Men, very Man, as we are in all things, sin onely excepeed.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">The union of these two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. John 1.14. Mat. 1.16. Gal. 4.4. Col. 2.9. 1 Tim. 2.5.</note> is also evident by those Scriptures, which Teach that <hi>the Word was made Flesh;</hi> made Flesh, (that is) he became man of a reasonable Soule, and humane Body, not by changing the God-head, but by assuming the Man-head. In which respect, he is said <hi>to be born of his Mother,</hi> and <hi>made of a woman.</hi> And the <hi>fulnesse of the God-head to dwell in him bodily,</hi> it does not dwell by way of Influence or Gifts, but <hi>bodily</hi> (that is personally conjoyning two Natures in one and the same Person, which is that one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus.

That <hi>hat holy Thing, which shall be borne of thee, shall be called the Son of God.</hi> The Son that is borne of the Virgin, is the Son of God, by birth; and why? because of this union; and so the

If it be demanded how these things can stand together? your distinction tells you, because he is both God and Man in one Person, therefore his name is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, he is the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> and of <hi>David,</hi> as he is Man, and <hi>Davids</hi> Lord, and <hi>Maries</hi> Maker, in respect of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: He is equall with his Father, as touching his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, inferiour to the Father, as touching his Man-head, &amp;c. as in <hi>Athanasius</hi>'s Creed it is expressed.</p>

And seeing God hath honoured our Nature to be the flesh of the Son of God, and hath made it his owne inseparable Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; we cannot now conceive, how God should without Man, either exercise Divine Power, or receive Divine Praise: For man is in both an Associate of Deity, because he is that Man, of whom God himselfe is a part; To be <hi>the Way, the Truth, and the Life;</hi> to be our <hi>Wisdome, Righteousnesse, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, Resurrection;</hi> to be the <hi>Peace of the World, the Hope of the Fathers, the Heire of all things,</hi> to be that <hi>suprean Head, unto whom all power both in Heaven and Earth is given:</hi> These are titles above the Dignity and worth of any meer Man, yet true of Christ; even in that he is Man, but Man with whom Deity is personally joyned, of both which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, there is a co-operation often unto the same effect, and an Association alwaies.</p>
                  <p>By this Doctrine of two Natures joyned in one Person, you see it comes to passe, that some Actions are ascribed to Christ, as <hi>God,</hi> because his Deity alone is the well-spring,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:205094:63"/>from which they flow. Some things, as <hi>Man,</hi> because they issue from his meer humane nature. Some things joyntly, as both <hi>God &amp; Man,</hi> because both Natures concurre as Principles thereunto; and so Christ is truly said in that respect, to work both as God and as Man to one and the same effect, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by Co-operation, alwayes by an undivided Association, as hath been shewed.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a further benefit in this Doctrine, (namely to answer most Doubts, and to decide most Questions about the Person of Christ, I will instance onely in two principall Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections of the Adversary.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is said in</hi> 1 Cor. 15.28. <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>[When all things shall be subdued unto him, then shall the Son also himselfe be subject unto him, that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.] When he hath delivered up his mediatory Kingdome to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son shall remain still subject unto him. How then is he equall to his Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, <hi>(The Son himselfe)</hi> in that capacity, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> wherein he hath hitherto reigned, shall be subject, (that is) Christ in his exalted and glorified Man-head, shall be subject; for in that Nature Christ hath been established King of the whole world, especially of his Church, to gather and govern it, and to destroy every enemy of its salvation: So the Apostle tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.20, 21, 22. <hi>God set him at his owne right hand in heavenly places, far above all Principalitie and Powers, and Might, and Dominion, and every name that is named, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this world, but also in that which is to come, and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be head over all things to the Church,</hi> with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. <hi>By the Resurrection of Jesus, who is gone into Heaven, and is on the right hand of God, Angels, and Authorities, and Powers, being made subject unto him.</hi> You see that Christ risen from the dead, is set above all things that can be named, God onely excepted, which did <hi>put all things under him,</hi> ver. 27.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.27. Acts 17.31.</note> for we may not think that the Father, by bestowing the office of a King upon the Son, hath dispossessed himself of his soveraigne Dominion. But when this exalted Son of God hath <hi>judged the World,</hi> and shall have finished his work in bringing of his Elect to glory,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:205094:64"/>then this King himselfe shall surrender up that King ship, which hitherto he hath exercised by the Ministry ofMen, Angels, Word, and Ordinances, and God shall reigne im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately over his Church, in a manner altogether new, (namely) by himself, without outward meanes, without mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry of Men or Angels, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thus we may gather in what kind the Son shall be subject unto God that gave him that power,<note place="margin">How Christ shall be subject to his Father. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28.</note> by the reason that here is rendered of such his subjection, which is this, <hi>That God may be all in all,</hi> that is, when Christ shall have brought his worke to an end, and all former Administrations of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome cease, then shall God be all in all; (that is) then shall God communicate himselfe, his light, life, blessednesse, love and glory to his Church in a most glorious, sweet, unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, immediate Communion, which indeed will not a whit disanull Christs kingdome, but only change that manner and forme thereof into a more sublime and perfect one.</p>
                  <p>Hence I conclude, First, looke into what capacity the Son was exalted to raigne over all; in the same capacity shall he be subject to make way for a new and more excellent manner of raigne over the Church; But the Son as Son of man, was raised and exalted to Rule, as is aforesaid, therefore the same Son, in the same capacity, in that assumed Nature (togehter with his Body, the Church, and his manner of governing it) shall be subject to make way to that new and unspeakably glorious way of Gods immediate communicating himselfe to his Elect throughout all eternity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I conclude with the words of <hi>Paraeus,</hi> in loc. <hi>Sicut filius tradit regnum Deo, &amp; Patri, sic etiam subjicietur Patri, non exuendo naturam, aut potentiam divinam, sed depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendo partes mediator is, &amp; mutando praesentem sui regni statum, ut immediatè ipse cum Patre &amp; Spiritu Sancto in aeternum regnet,</hi> that is, look in what respect Christ shall deliver up the Kingdome to his Father, in the same respect shall he be subject to his Father, (namely) not by putting his Divine Nature, or Power, but by ceasing to reign as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, changing the present way and state of his Kingdome into a better, wherein he, with the Father and the Holy Ghost,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:205094:64"/>shall immediately rule and dwell in the glorified Saints for evermore. This I take to be the plain meaning of that hard place of Scripture.</p>

Now some course must be taken, to make us partakers of the goodnesse and blessednesse, that is in God; for seeing all goodnesse is originally in God, and Man, at such a wide distance from him; therefore was the second Person, God, manifested in the Flesh, that being one with God, and one with Us, he might convey to us that goodnesse and blessednesse which we wanted. There is God the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, Man the empty Cisterne, Christ the Conduit-pipe, to convey Grace and Life from the Fountaine, Now the Pipe must come home both to the Fountaine, and to the

The first step of Conjoyning and Communicating of God to Man, is Christ manifest in the Flesh; By meanes of whom, as he was one with the Father by eternall Communion of the Divine Essence, so he is with us, by union of his Person with us, and so he is both in the Father and in us, and knits us both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: This is the summe of my Text, (namely) to teach us,<note place="margin">There <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>This is my beloved Son;</hi> none so loved of God, because none so in God, and for his sake he loveth all that be Christ's. <hi>John</hi> 3.35. <hi>The Father loveth the Son</hi> (not with a new, or Changeable love, but with an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Naturall love) and because he so loveth him, he hath <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven all things into his hand,</hi> that whosoever is coupled unto Christ, is sure to be loved of the Father also; Christ brings us into his Fathers love, for the Son loveth us as the Father loved him. <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.9. <hi>As my Father hath loved me, so have I loved you:</hi> What of that? Yes, it is much for our consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because the love of God towards us begins not in us, it is not procured by us; but it is grounded on his Fatherhood in Christ, and it descends to us from the everlasting bowels of God the Father, and of Christ. Hereupon it followes, that if ye have the Sons love, ye have the Fathers also: see <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.23. <hi>If any man love me, my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> The Son brings the Father with him into our hearts, Christ hath his Fathers love, by reason of his Union with him, and we have it by reason of our Union with Christ. <hi>John</hi> 17.26. <hi>I have declared unto them thy name, that the love, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with thou hast loved me, may be in them, and I in them;</hi> as if he should say, that thou mayest love them for my sake, and for their Union with me, as thou hast loved me their Head for my Unions sake with thee. Whole Christ is dearly loved of the Father, because we are of his Body, who is one with the Father, you are Christ's, and Christ is God's: yea, you are God's, because you are Christ's. The way to get God to be our God, is to get Union with Christ. This must be our method to get God; for he that hath the Son hath the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther also: till we get into Christ, we are strangers to God, yea, enemies to God, without strength, hopelesse, helplesse creatures: But by our Union with the Son, it comes to passe, that his Father is our Father, and his God our God: <hi>It is the Father's will that he that seeth and believeth on the Son, may have everlasting life,</hi> John 6.40.</p>

                  <p>NOw followes the third kind of Union,<note n="3" place="margin">Spirituall Union.</note> (namely) that <hi>spirituall</hi> Union which is between Christ and his Church, whereby we are incorporated and made members of that mysticall Body whereof Christ is Head. <hi>Ephesians</hi> 5.30. <hi>We are members of his Body, of his Flesh, and of his Bones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a mutuall Union or in Beeing of Christ in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, and of a Christian in Christ: or thus, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                     </label> We are united unto the Person of Christ, so as to be one with him; Thou art in Christ, and Christ in thee.</p>
                  <p>For proofs; so <hi>John</hi> 6.56. <hi>He that eateth my Flesh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 6 56. opened.</note>
                     <hi>and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me and I in him.</hi> There is that mutuall in-dwelling we speak of, and the means of it is our eating of his Flesh, and drinking of his Blood; we are as truly joyned unto his Person, as our meat and drink is with our Bodies This eating is not carnall and bodily, but yet true and reall, for spirituall things are reall things: Christ is resembled to Food, and Faith to eating, because it doth cause the Soule to receive Christ, to feed and to satisfie it self upon his Love and Merits, as with marrow and fatnesse. Christ's flesh was given for the life of the World, <hi>ratione acquisitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> when he laid down his life for it: And it is given to the World <hi>ratione applicationis,</hi> when it is offered to us in the Gospel, and in the Sacraments. And Christ is eaten when the Soul doth receive and embrace him by a personall parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Faith.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, consider that of <hi>John,</hi> 17.21, 22.23.<note place="margin">Iohn 17.22. opened.</note> Christ there prayeth thus for Believers, that they may be one, <hi>as thou Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us,</hi> that is, that they may be United among themselves in the same
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:205094:69"/>spirit of Faith and Love, and that the bond of their Union may be their Joynt-interest and Communion which they have in us; as if he should say, because all true Believers are one in us, in us they all meet, therefore they should be one among themselves, as Members of one Body, under one Head,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.5.</note>
                     <hi>Christ Iesus,</hi> Sons of <hi>one Father,</hi> who is <hi>over all,</hi> &amp; <hi>in them all,</hi> they that are in God, must be one among themselves: This our Union and meeting in one God, in one Lord Jesus Christ, is the only true ground and bond of Union among Christians.</p>
                  <p>It followes (ver. 22.) <hi>And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them, that they may be one, even as we are one.</hi> The Churches Union with Christ her Head, is the Churches Glory.</p>
                  <p>Note first, it is an unspeakable glory bestowed on the human Nature of Christ, to be united to the Godhead: This <hi>Glory</hi> (sayes Christ) <hi>thou gavest me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, note, Christ sayes, This <hi>Glory I have given them,</hi> they are partakers of it, because they are united unto me, and by me unto thee. The Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is in the first degree of glorious Union, being united unto God personally: We the Sons of men are in a second degree, partakers of that Glory, being really united unto the Man <hi>Christ,</hi> so that the same Glory which the Man <hi>Christ</hi> received of the Father, (namely) to be one with God: He bestowes on us (namely) to be one with himself, and by him to be one with God, as it followes, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>I in them, and Thou in me:</hi> Here God is in Christ <hi>(thou in me)</hi> and Christ is in us <hi>(I in them)</hi> here is God, Christ, and Us; Christ is the link that joynes us unto God; <hi>Tin them,</hi> (there's Christ in us) and <hi>thou in me</hi> (there's God in Christ) so that in Christ God and we meet, and so the glory which God gave to Christ, he gives to us, and so we are made perfect in one, being firmly, and for ever united and knit unto God; from whence it followes undenyably, all the world must confesse and grant it, that thou hast sent me, &amp; hast loved them as thou hast loved me; they whom thou hast honoured, to be brought so neere to thy self in a blessed Union, must needs be neere to thee in most tender affection. It is a glory to Christ to be one with the Father. It is a glory to a Christian to be one with Christ, and it is the glory of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:205094:69"/>Christians to be one among themselves. Thus much for proof of the point.</p>
                  <p>For further Explication of this mysterie I shall shew four things; First, what kinde of Union this is,<note place="margin">Four things concerning our Union with Christ.</note> that we have with Christ: Secondly, the manner and meanes by which it is made: Thirdly, the necessity of it: Fourthly, the Uses.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What kinde of Ʋnion is it that we have with Christ?</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer, First negatively, It is not a <hi>personall Ʋnion,</hi> we are not one person with Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is not a <hi>corporall,</hi> or bodily Union, such as in the joynts of the body; my hand and my foot are united to my head by skin, flesh, and sinews: The joynts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are compacted by bodily ligaments: 'Tis not so between Christ and us, Christ is in Heaven, and we on Earth; and as touching locall and bodily Union, we are absent from the Lord: This Union is spirituall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is not onely <hi>mentall,</hi> or in conceit, or <hi>specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> by imagination, but reall, and a thing existing, <hi>extra mentem,</hi> whether we conceit it or not. There is a reall rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and respect between parties, as between Father and Son, Head and Foot: It is a Father, it is a Son, it is a Member, whether we think it or not: so here Christ and we are one, not onely in speculation or imagination, but really, whether you think it or not; and that Union produceth reall effects and operations in us, therefore the Union is reall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Christ and we are one, not onely by <hi>Covenant,</hi> and mutuall consent. This is much, but this is not all; Christ is Ours by his own Act and Will, and we are His by our own Act and Will.</p>
                  <p>The Obligation is mutuall, God by his Covenant makes over himselfe to be our God, and we restipulate and make over our selves to be his people. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>I entred into a Covenant with thee, and thou becamest mine.</hi> This is like a Marriage Covenant, by vertue of which Man and Wife are one Person in Law, so is Christ and the Church: <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.31, 32. <hi>A man shall leave Father and Mother, and shall be joyned unto his Wife, and they two shall be one flesh:</hi> As it is in this civill Contract, so it is between Christ and us: <hi>ver.</hi> 32.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:205094:70"/>
                     <hi>This is a great mysterie, but I speak concerning Christ and the Church.</hi> By vertue of this Covenant the Church saith (<hi>Cant.</hi> 6.3.) <hi>My Beloved is mine, and I am his;</hi> Christ and a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian are linked together in covenant, and have given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves each to other:<note place="margin">Isa 54.1.</note> First freely, secondly fully.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>freely;</hi> Christ looks for no portion with us, he takes us in our rags, when we were enemies, and without strength, and had never done any thing pleasing to him; He loves us freely. And we take Christ freely with a free consent of heart and will, not compulsatorie. Many in times of danger, in time of sicknesse and death, will seem earnest for Christ, O nothing but Christ. In their afflictions they seek me early, but when the danger is past, their affection is cooled, and Christ is laid aside. In a storm, the Marriners will throw their goods into the Sea to save their lives: This is a forced act, but our taking of Christ is not so, it is by way of choice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ gives himself unto us <hi>fully,</hi> and wholly; all his riches are ours, with Christ God gives all things. And we againe do fully give up our selves unto him, we are for him in one thing as well as in another, against all crosses, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutions, we accept Christ with all those conditions which are proposed in the Gospel, we submit every opposite desire to his Will, we take him with full consent to be our Lord and King, our God and Saviour. Thus Christ is ours, and we are his by Covenant: and both parties have testified and ratified the consent by the Sacrament of Baptisme, in which, as by a solemn Instrument in Law, he receives us into his flock and family, to bestow upon us the blessing of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and we, as by a solemn Oath, together with our names, do give up our selves to the profession, worship, and service of that God, who is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. This Bond by mutuall covenant and consent, makes us very nigh each to other, but though this be much, yet this is not all, there is a further degree of Union between Christ and a Christian.</p>

                  <p>The second Resemblance, whereby this neere union is set forth, is that of the <hi>Vine</hi> and <hi>Branches,</hi> John 15.5. <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches:</hi> Now the Root is, and liveth in the Branch, and the Branch in the Root,<note place="margin">Galat. 2.20.</note> so doth <hi>Christ live in us,</hi> He is the Root that Bears us, and <hi>we live in him,</hi> as saith the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 24. <hi>We that are wilde by nature, are graffed contrary to nature, into a good Olive Tree, and so partake of the Root and Fatnesse of the Olive Tree,</hi> we have a Conjunction, not onely with the Vertue and Merit of Christ, but with his Person, as the Branch hath with the Vine: He that drinketh a Cup of Wine, doth partake of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:205094:71"/>the Fruit of the Vine, yet not so as the Branch doth, for the Branch is in the Vine, it subsists and lives in the Root, and the Root liveth in the Branch. <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches,</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, the other worke is the actuall influence of Grace, whereby we begin to live the life of Grace,<note place="margin">G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>You see then that the chief bond to Unite us unto Christ, is the holy Spirit, both in respect of his presence, and also as he is a Spirit of Graces, fitting us for Union with Christ; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which sort, he is not in the reprobate, though he fill all places. This is on Christs part.</p>
                  <p>The second Bond of this Union on our parts is <hi>Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bishop <hi>Usher</hi> Sum. p. 193.</note> which is the first and more generall effect and instrument of the Spirit of Christ in us, disposing and enabling us to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and cleave to him.

                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:205094:72"/>
                  <p>This inward hold-fast which Christ hath of us, and we of him,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.12.</note> is mutuall, <hi>He apprehends us</hi> in our perishing condition, and <hi>we apprehend him,</hi> just as a man fallen into water, he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth his hand to us, and we put forth our hand to catch hold of him: There is hand in hand, Christ clasping us by his Spirit,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.176.</note> we him by the hand of Faith: Christ first <hi>seekes</hi> us that were <hi>lost,</hi> and by his spirit layes hold on us; then do we that fled from him, turn to him, and lay hold on Christ: Jesus first speaks to us, as once to <hi>Mary,</hi> John 20.16. Shee heard him speak before, <hi>ver.</hi> 15. but knew him not: but now Christ speaks to her heart in the voice of a Friend; Jesus saith unto her, <hi>Mary,</hi> my friend <hi>Mary.</hi> Then she turned her self and saith unto him, <hi>Rabboni,</hi> it is <hi>my Master,</hi> it is my Christ, my Lord, my Love, that was crucified.</p>
                  <p>Thus Christ speaks to our hearts, <hi>Iohn, Thomas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>(Why weepest thou? Whom seekest thou?)</hi> And the heart forthwith answers with joy,<note place="margin">Iohn 6.37. Iohn 17.10.</note>

                  <p>Amongst the Errors rejected by their Synod in <hi>New England,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Short Hist. p. 9.</note> this was one, (namely) <hi>That we are complealy uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christ, before, or without any Faith wrought in us by the Spirit.</hi> Of which Error, because Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> was supposed to give some occasion: This question, among others, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed unto him by certain Ministers of those Churches, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Assembly met,<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> in his way of the Churches clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> (namely) <hi>Whether our Ʋnion with Christ be compleat before and without Faith, whereto</hi> (saith Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>) <hi>I gave this answer, not without, nor before the habitor gift of Faith, but before the act of Faith, that is, not before Christ hath wrought Faith in us, (for in uniting himself to us, he worketh Faith in us) yet in order of Nature, before our Faith doth put forth it self to lay hold on him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Answer if expressed onely in those words (namely) [not before Christ hath wrought Faith in us, for in uniting himself to us, he worketh Faith in us] had been more cleere and full, whereas by distinguishing the Habit from the Act
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:205094:72"/>of Faith, and affirming that we are United to Christ by the Spirit, before our Faith doth put forth any act to lay hold on Christ, is very ambiguous, and unsatisfactory.</p>
                  <p>For, First it seemes to savour of the Leaven of <hi>Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anisme</hi> and <hi>Enthusiasme</hi> (namely) that the Spirit doth all without us, witnesseth our justification absolutely without relation to any thing in us, and so Uniteth us to Christ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, or any act of ours concurring therein.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is inconsistent with it selfe, for what doth the working of Faith in us availe, as to our uniting unto Christ, more than the working of Patience, or any other Grace, if the Union be compleat before our Faith doth put forth it self to lay hold on Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To distinguish between the habit and act of Faith, hath no place, neither can it be rightly applied to the point in hand: for our Faith is begun in action, it begins in the acts of Consent and Adherence, and therefore if the Spirit doth unite us to Christ, before and without any act of Faith, it doth unite us before and without any Faith at all.</p>
                  <p>In morall Philosophy, the habit of vertue is nothing but a setled disposition or permanent quality facilitating unto action through long custome, and is therefore called an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Habit:</hi> But the Scriptures speake more divinely, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Principles of Grace <hi>the seed of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 3 9.</note>
                     <hi>He that is born of God sinneth not, because his seed remaineth in him.</hi> Now what is that <hi>seed,</hi> by which we are born of God? S. <hi>Peter</hi> (1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1.23.) tells you, it is the <hi>Word of truth,</hi> the Gospel of your salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which being received in the heart, <hi>liveth and abideth in you.</hi> Whence I thus argue: The seed of Faith, is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Faith; but the Word actually heard and embraced, is that seed of God; therefore our Faith is begun in action. Again (<hi>Gal.</hi> 3.2.) the Apostle sayes, that <hi>we receive the Spirit by the hearing of Faith,</hi> that is, by the Doctrine of Faith, as if he should say, the Spirit of God is given and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed in, and with the Gospel preached: by both which concurring, Faith is wrought in the heart, and claspeth Jesus Christ; by the hearing of Faith the Spirit is received and by the Spirit the grace of Faith: And so Christ uniteth himself
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:205094:73"/>to us by his own act, enlivening us, and making the Word powerfull to covert us: And we again unite unto him by our own act of Faith, receiving him thus offered to us.</p>
                  <p>The Union then is begun by action of the Spirit on us, and of Faith put forth by us to lay hold on Christ: Hereof it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, that if this Union be compleat before the Act of Faith put forth to lay hold on Christ, it is compleat without Faith at all. Now when Faith is thus wrought in us, by reason of its permanency in us, and also because it is the root of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall actions, it is called <hi>the habit of Faith</hi> (not according to Scripture-phrase, but the language of Philosophers and School-men) yet an <hi>infused</hi> habit, because it is gotten not by customable actions or use, but by the operation of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the Word preached; It is the <hi>Faith of the operation of God,</hi> Col. 2.12.</p>
                  <p>How far forth the forementioned Ministers were satisfied in Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>'s Answer, it is not materiall to enquire (onely the Lord of his mercy continue and increase their amiable Communion together.) Howbeit, when that Question was brought into that Assembly, they resolved and decreed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Union with Christ before Faith, roundly and intirely, without mincing or distinguishing of the <hi>Habit</hi> and <hi>Act</hi> of Faith,<note place="margin">Short Hist. p. 9. Error 37.</note> in these words, <hi>The terme</hi> [united] <hi>being understood of that spirituall relation of Men unto Christ, whereby they come to have life and right to all other blessings in Christ,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.12. <hi>And the terme</hi> [Compleatly] <hi>implying a presence of all those Bands and Ligaments, and meanes, as are required in the Word, or are any wayes necessary to the making up of the Ʋnion; we now conceive that this Assertion is erroneous, and contrary to Scripture, which either expresly mentioneth Faith, when it spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of this Ʋnion,</hi> (Eph. 3.17. That Christ may dwell in our hearts by Faith. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. Christ liveth in me by Faith:) <hi>or ever implieth it in those phrases, that do expresse Ʋnion, as</hi> coming to Christ, <hi>John</hi> 6.35. <hi>and</hi> eating and drinking Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 47. <hi>compared with ver.</hi> 54. having the Son, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5 12. <hi>and</hi> receiving Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. <hi>and</hi> marriage unto Christ, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.32. <hi>If there be no dwelling of Christ in us, no coming to him, no receiving him, no eating nor drinking him, no being

Another, perhaps can hardly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the sight of our sores, yet we dresse it, and handle it gently, and Why? because it is ours, because there is life in it, because it is one of our members: So is Christ to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, he heales the broken-hearted, he <hi>seeks</hi> that <hi>one sheepe</hi> that is gone <hi>astray.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, So Christ taketh the good done to us, as done to himself <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.40. <hi>Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> In like manner is the sound Christian touched and affected with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dishonour, that befalls Christ, he can say with truth of heart, <hi>The reproaches of them that reproached thee, are fallen upon me.</hi> The reproaches that befall Religion through the miscarriages of its professors, are a grief to a godly man: so the godly, in the Prophet <hi>Zephaniah</hi>'s time, which laid to heart, the calamities of the Church, and the corruptions thereof, are singled out as the speciall objects of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3 18. <hi>I will gather them that be sorrowfull for the solemne Assembly, who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.</hi> The solemne Assemblies, the Sabbaths, the publique Worship and Ordinances of God, These are things most precious to the godly, highly prized and joyed in, and the want of them was their sorrow and lamentation, and the rather because their enemies,<note place="margin">Lam. 1.7. Psal. 42.3.</note> in their exile, did <hi>mock at their Sabbaths,</hi> and twit them with their Religion. This reproach done to Religion, is a burden to the true Child, and Member of the Church: So in these our daies, the Name and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Christ is greatly dishonoured, through the miscarriages of many professors: Christ may justly complain of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that call themselves the godly party, as once <hi>Jacob</hi> did of his two Sons,<note place="margin">Gen. 34.16, 25.</note>
                     <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi,</hi> who treacherously, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their covenant, slew the <hi>Shechemites:</hi> Gen. 34.30. <hi>You have troubled me, to make me stink among the inhabitants of the Land,</hi> as if he should say, you have disgraced me and my Religion, and the God whom we serve; the very <hi>Canaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi> must needs abhor both us and our Religion. Now they that have in them any spark of the spirit of Christ, cannot chuse but be troubled, when Christ, whom they love, is so
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:205094:76"/>dishonoured, and evill spoken of.<note place="margin">Phil. 3.18.</note>
                     <hi>Many walk</hi> (sayes <hi>Paul) of whom I tell you, even weeping, that they are enemies of the Crosse of Christ;</hi> Any wrong done to Christ, any disgrace that reflects upon his name, doth wound the heart of a true Christian.</p>
                  <p>But on the other side, when Christs Name, Gospel and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is magnified, it is the joy &amp; rejoycing of the heart of any one that has the spirit of Christ in him, yea, it is more deare and precious to him than his own credit or profit. When some preached Christ at <hi>Philippi,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 1.18.</note> out of a design to adde af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to <hi>Paul</hi>'s bonds: however it went with <hi>Paul,</hi> so <hi>Christ were preached,</hi> he <hi>rejoyced. Paul</hi> was a man variously reported and censured. But (saith he) whether ye count me mad or sober, it is not much materiall, I will not shape my Doctrine to please Men or Times, because the love of Christ is dearer to me than my selfe, <hi>if we be besides our selves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor 5.13.</note>
                     <hi>it is to God</hi> (that is) I doe not care for being held a mad man for Gods service; and he gives a reason, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. because the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite love of Christ, who died for us, doth interchangeably bind us to consecrate unto him our honour and credit, yea, our whole life, which we hold by his benefit.</p>
                  <p>It was an excellent speech of <hi>Joshua,</hi> in his prayer, when the people fled before the men of <hi>Ai: The Canaanits</hi> (saith he) <hi>and all the Inhabitants of the Land, shall hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name from the Earth.</hi> This might justly be for a lamentation: yet there was something that did stick neerer to his heart than their own name, and that was the glory of God, for so he addeth,<note place="margin">Numb. 14.15. Rom. 9.3. Josh. 7.9.</note>
                     <hi>And what wilt thou doe unto thy great Name?</hi> As if he should say, provide for the glory of thy great name, whatever become of us, and though our name be cut off.</p>
                  <p>The second triall, whether Christ be in us,<note n="2" place="margin">Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto Christ.</note> is taken from our conformity, and likenesse unto Jesus Christ: for as we have born the Image of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> in Sin and Shame, so we must bear the Image of Christ, the second <hi>Adam,</hi> in Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and Power: if Christ be in you, he will soon transform you into his own likenesse; for he is a quickning Spirit, he mortifies lusts, and quickens to newnesse of life: So saith the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:205094:77"/>Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.13.10.</note>
                     <hi>If Christ be in you, the Body is dead, because of Sin, but the Spirit is life, because of Righteousnesse;</hi> as if he should say, The presence of Christs Spirit in us is manifested by our Mortification of the old Man, and Renovation, or Vivificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the new Man: the Body is subject unto Death, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the remainders of Sin,<note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> but our spirituall part is alive, and hath in it the seeds of eternall life, by reason of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse wherewith it is indued. By vertue of which Spirit dwelling in us, our mortall bodies also shall be quickned, and raised to glory. So (<hi>Gal</hi> 5 24.25.) he saith, <hi>They that are Christs, have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts;</hi> Christ dwells not in a heart where lusts beare sway, Christ de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth in us the works of the Devil; the Spirit of Christ is operative, like fire, it is not idle, but effectuall, and its first operation is to subdue its contrary, and to transforme the soule into his own liknesse: Christ is a living Head, a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Head, an holy Head; we may not think, that we can be dead Members of that living Head, nor unholy Members of an holy Head:<note place="margin">1 John 1.6.</note>
                     <hi>If we say we have fellowship with him, and walk in darknesse, we lie, and do not the truth,</hi> for if we have fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship with him,<note place="margin">Verse 7.</note> we must <hi>walk in the light, as he is in the light.</hi> No man counteth that a member of his Body which is not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by his Soule; and no man counts that a true member of his Body, which does not grow like the parts of a mans body in humane shape; if his foot be like the foot of a Beast, or his hands like the claw of a Bird, we count it a monstrous Birth: Christ is not severed from his Spirit, nor his Spirit from the operations of his Spirit; therefore it is said, <hi>if we live in the Spirit,</hi>

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:205094:77"/>Consider, thou that pretendest union with Christ, What hast thou gotten by all thy Communion with him? All Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with the creature is of an alterative Power, if we be cold, by Communion with the fire we get heat: If we be hungry, or Thirsty, and Faint, by Communion with the creatures of Bread, and Drinke, and Food, we are filled, and cheared, and revived, as <hi>Jonathan</hi> with tasting of hony. If we be sick, by taking of Physick we are eased, &amp;c. And shall not our Communion with Christ, the Lord of life be much more powerfull to quicken and change our dead hearts to spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize our sinfull affections, to Alter our vaine conversations? if you thinke otherwise, you doe Ascribe more Efficacy to the Creature than to the Creator.</p>
                  <p>Againe, consider the Apostles Rule, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6.<note place="margin">In outward Conversation. Ezek. 10.17.</note>
                     <hi>He that saith, he abideth in him, ought himselfe also to walke even as Christ walked.</hi> In the 10 of <hi>Ezek.</hi> There is shewen to the Prophet, a vision of <hi>Wheels</hi> and <hi>Cherubims</hi> ver. 16.17. <hi>when the Cherubims went, the wheels went by them, when they stood, these stood, and when they were lifted up, these lift up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also, for the Spirit of the living Creature was in the wheels.</hi> This may resemble and serve to illustrate our present point, a Christian walkes, as <hi>Christ</hi> walked, which way <hi>Christ</hi> moves, they move, which way <hi>Christ</hi> leads, they follow: and why? Because the spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> is in them.</p>
                  <p>Now observe how Christ walked, Take him in his Fathers family, he is obedient to his Parents. Take him in his owne Family, he Instructs them, and Prayes with them. Take him in the Common-wealth, he is subject to Authority; He payes Tribute, he renders unto <hi>Cesar</hi> the things that be <hi>Cesars.</hi> Take him in the Church, he is a constant Hearer, he goes to the Synagogues every Sabbath day; he is a carefull observer of all Gods Ordinances, from the first to the last; though the Ministers were corrupt in their office. Take him in his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; it is his <hi>meat</hi> and his <hi>drink</hi> to be doing his Fathers Will; <hi>He seekes not his own glory, but the glory of him that sent him.</hi> Consider him in his carriage towards others, he is lowly and meek in company, he is still doing some good. Consider him in his Sufferings, he is patient under them, not rendring evil

                     </label> this one Conclusion (namely) That the Holy Ghost is a Person in the Deity, distinct from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son together with the Father and the Son, to be worshipped and glorified.</p>
                  <p>This one conclusion takes in all the forementioned Errors; for if he be a Person in the Deity, then he is not a Creature, then he is not meerely the gift, or energy of God; then he is every where otherwise than any created Angel is, and then he must be worshipped as God.</p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:205094:79"/>
                  <p>Now because this truth is sufficiently evicted already in the Doctrine of the Trinity (for those Scriptures which prove a Trinity of Persons,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cap.</hi> 2. §. 2.3</note> do prove the Person-ship of the Holy Ghost) therefore I shall content my self with some few proofes peculiar to the point in hand. I shall reduce my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to these four heads.</p>
                  <p>First, The Holy Ghost is expresly in Scripture called <hi>God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Proofes.</note> Acts 5.3.4.9. <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Peter</hi> reproving <hi>Ananias</hi> for lying to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, saith, <hi>Thou hast not lyed unto Men but unto God;</hi> therefore the Holy Ghost is God. <hi>Paul</hi> proves that our bodies are <hi>the Temples of the living God,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.16.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.16.</note> because of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> which <hi>dwelleth in us.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>9. <hi>Know ye not that your Body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you?</hi> He that in one place is called <hi>the Holy Ghost,</hi> in the other place is called <hi>the Living God.</hi> So again, compare <hi>Isa.</hi> 6.8, 9. with <hi>Acts</hi> 28.25, 26. In <hi>Isaiah</hi> it is said, <hi>I heard the voice of the Lord, him that sate on the Throne</hi> (ver. 1.) <hi>saying, Whom shall I send? Then said I, Here am I, send me. And he</hi> (that is, the Lord) <hi>said, Goe and tell this People. Hear ye indeed.</hi> &amp;c. This place is expresly applied by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and expounded of the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> Acts 28.25, 26. <hi>They departed after that</hi> Paul <hi>had spoken one word, well spake the Holy Ghost by</hi> Isaiah <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet unto our Fathers, saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ye shall heare, and not understand,</hi> &amp;c. The Lord that sent <hi>Isaiah</hi> in that errand, is in the <hi>Acts</hi> called the Holy Ghost; therefore the Holy Ghost is God.</p>
                  <p>The second Reason is taken from the works, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>2</label> which are ascribed to the Holy Ghost, which cannot be done by any creature, much lesse by a Quality or Gift: None but a God can do them: Such works are these.</p>
                  <p>First, Works of <hi>Creation; Job</hi> saith, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
                     <hi>The Spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty hath given me life,</hi> Job 33.4. The framing of the Body of Christ of the Seed of the Virgin, was the work of a God; it was a Creation above the power of Nature, or of any Creature. <hi>Jerem.</hi> 31.22. <hi>I create a new thing in the Earth, a Woman shall compasse a Man.</hi> This new great work was done by the Holy Ghost. Mat. 1.20. <hi>Feare not to take unto thee</hi> Mary, <hi>thy Wife, for that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:205094:80"/>which is conceived in her,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1.35.</note>
                     <hi>is of the Holy Ghost:</hi> The Holy Ghost was the Author of that miraculous conception, it was by the power of the Holy Ghost; ver. 18. <hi>She was found with child of the Holy Ghost.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second work is our <hi>Regeneration,</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> which is ascribed to the Holy Ghost. 1 Pet. 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit, and sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus Christ:</hi> Here ye have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of all Three Persons in the salvation of man, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther electing us, the Holy Ghost sanctifying us, Jesus Christ shedding his Blood for us: So our Saviour (<hi>John</hi> 3.3, 5.) ascribes our new Birth unto the Holy Ghost, <hi>Except a man be born</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>
                     <hi>from above,</hi> (that is, of the Spirit, which is from above) <hi>he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third work is the bestowing of spirituall Gifts and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12 3.11.</note>
                     <hi>There are diversities of Gifts, of Ministeries, and of Operations; but it is the same God, the same Spirit, which wer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all in all:</hi> There were poured forth on the Church gifts of Knowledge, of Tongues, of working Miracles, there be severall energies put forth, but all these worke that one, and the self-same Spirit. The Gifts are many, the Spirit one; therefore the Spirit is not the Gifts; for then the Spirit also should be many, and not one, or else the Gifts should be but one, and not many. In this place the Gifts and the Giver are severall things, really distinguished: so <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is Love, Joy, Peace,</hi> &amp;c. The Spirit, and the graces of the Spirit are severall things; the Works and the Worker are not the same thing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> There are divers other works ascribed to the Holy Ghost, which are the proper actions of a Person, which is God, which cannot be understood <hi>de virtute soli patri pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priâ,</hi> and therefore they do clearly manifest. <hi>Spiritum San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum non esse nudam virtutem Patris</hi> (such as was in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, when they did their Miracles, they did them by <hi>the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God,</hi> by the power of Gods Spirit) but a Person in the godhead, distinct from the Father: such are sending of Apostles to the work of the Ministery. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.2. <hi>And as they mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred unto the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:205094:80"/>me</hi> Barrabas <hi>and</hi> Saul <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them:</hi> Obs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>erve in that place a double sending, one <hi>ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi> by the Prophets and Teachers, that were at <hi>Antioch:</hi> ver. 3. <hi>They fasted and prayed, and layed their hands on them, and sent them away.</hi> The other <hi>authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ative,</hi> and by expresse command; v. 4. <hi>So they being sent forth by the Holy Ghost, depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto</hi> Seleucia, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The Holy Ghost inspiring and speaking in the Prophets, and revealing things to come. S. <hi>Peter</hi> ascribes the inditing of Scripture to the Holy Ghost: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost:</hi> yea, the Holy Ghost is said to speak by them, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.16. <hi>This Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture must needs be fulfilled which the Holy Ghost spake by the mouth of</hi> David <hi>concerning</hi> Judas, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To speak, to indite, and enable the Prophets to speak of things to come, are acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons agreeing to none, but to a Person, where the gift of Prophesie bestowed, is evidently distinguished from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, ver. 8. There Christ saith to the Apostles, <hi>Ye shall receive power a ter that the Holy Ghost is come upon you,</hi> so that the Holy Ghost is the Person that endued them with that power, the thing received was power of Apostle-ship, the Giver of that Power is the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Of this nature is the appearing of the Holy Ghost in a bodily shape. <hi>Luke</hi> 3.22. <hi>The Holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, like a Dove, upon Christ</hi> at his Baptisme, and is brought in as a third Person, witnessing unto Christs Baptism, and his Inauguration into his office. Now how can an acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent take to its self a bodily shape, seeing it hath no subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stence of its own?</p>
                  <p>Now to gather up this second Argument, I demand, The holy Ghost, Is he a Creator, or a Creature? If a Creator, then he is God; If a Creature, then he cannot do these works; He could not create the body of Christ, he could not regenerate us, nor be the Bestower of those spirituall Gifts and Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, &amp;c. These and the like operations are ascribed to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost properly, as the Author, and efficient cause, not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guratively, as when it is said, <hi>The blood of</hi> Abel <hi>crieth,</hi> &amp;c. yea, as the principall cause, not as a quality, or instrument, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:205094:81"/>from God, by which God doth work; because in God such instrumental causes have no place, who worketh all things <hi>per immediationem suppositi</hi> by himself.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed, that the word (<hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>) doth sometimes signifie the Gifts, the power and graces of the Holy Ghost; as when it is said, that <hi>the Holy Ghost was given by the laying on of the Apostles hands,</hi> Acts 8.17. and that <hi>they had not heard whether there were any Holy Ghost,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 3.7.20. 2 Pet. 1.3.</note> Acts 19.2. that is, they had not heard of that visible miraculous manifestation of the Holy Ghost. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine, but be ye filled with the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. But is this all that is spoken of the Holy Ghost? Is the Holy Ghost nothing else but these gifts and graces? Or is it possible that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned operations and works of Creation, Regeneration, donation of Gifts, sending of Apostles, speaking by their Mouths, and appearing in a bodily shape, can be ascribed to any other than to a divine Person?</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Arrians</hi> were of opinion, that besides Gods own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Wisdome, there is a Wisdome which God created before all things,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hooker,</hi> p. 293.</note> to the end that he might thereby create all things else; and that this created Wisdome, was the Word that took Flesh; so making Christ but a Creature. The same Blasphemy do the <hi>Socinians</hi> breath out against Gods most holy Spirit,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Stegm</hi> p. 101.</note> denying him to be a Person in the Deity, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the Holy Ghost is but <hi>virtus quaedam Dei, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter ab ipso distincta, per quam ipse ea, quae ad salutis nostrae ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotium pertinent,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Racov.</hi> Cat. p. 167.</note>
                     <hi>operetur:</hi> that is, the Holy Ghost (say they) is nothing but a certain kind of vertue, power, or influence, which God doth put forth in producing this or that effect for the good of the Church: As power to heale is the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of some Herbs: the vertue or efficacy of Fire is to heat the Water. So here the Heretick calls the Holy Ghost a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ministring Spirit among the good Angels.</p>

                     </label> and prove the contrary from three places of Scripture; the first is Christs words, <hi>John</hi> 16.13, 14. descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Holy Ghost in this manner: <hi>He shall not speak of
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:205094:81"/>himselfe. He shall glorifieme, for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew it unto you.</hi> Now this cannot possibly be understood of God the Father, nor of the vertue of the Father, because the Father doth not receive from the Son, neither doth the Father speak from the Son, but of himself, because the Son is of the Father, and the Father is not of the Son; therefore we finde in Scripture that the Father sendeth the Son, but never that the Son sendeth the Father: In like manner, because the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and the Son, we finde that both the Father and the Son do send the Holy Ghost, and act by him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Usher</hi> sum. p. 85.</note> but never that the Holy Ghost doth send or act by either the Father or the Son: <hi>All things that the Father hath are mine</hi> (saith Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 15.) that is, the Son receiveth from him, as coming from him and so whatsoever the Holy Ghost hath, he hath it not of himself, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. but from the Son, <hi>He shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you, ver.</hi> 14. he being a Person proceeding as well from the Son, as from the Father. Hence it is evident, that the Holy Ghost being sent by Christ, and receiving of Christ, and speaking from Christ <hi>(He shall receive of mine, and shew it unto you)</hi> is in order of subsisting, and working after the Son, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not a quality or vertue of the Father, who giveth to, and speaketh by the Son, not the Son by the Father, as hath been said.</p>
                  <p>The second is that 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7. <hi>There are three that beare Record in Heaven</hi> to us men on earth,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Hence it is evident, that there be three di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:205094:82"/>Witnesses in heaven; The Father testifies of Christ, that he is his Son;<note place="margin">John 5.37. John 8 42.</note> the Son testifies of himselfe, that he came forth from the Father, and the Holy Ghost beares witnesse to them both, and confirmes both their Testimonies. Now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to our present purpose; if the holy Ghost be but the vertue of the Father, his Testimony is twice repeated; and there would not be three, but onely two Witnesses in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, The Father, the Son, and the vertue of the Father again, if the Holy Ghost be but the vertue of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>The third place is <hi>John</hi> 15.16. <hi>When the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you, even the spirit of Truth, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from the Father, he shall testifie of me.</hi> Note first, that this is another Comforter distinct from the Father and the Son.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>I shall conclude this point with a reason demonstrating that the Holy Ghost is not <hi>nuda virtus Dei Patris,</hi> and the reason is taken from the personall Inhabitation of the Holy Ghost in the Regenerate;<note n="2" place="margin">Whether the holy Ghost dwell in us by I his gifts onely?</note> the Holy Ghost dwels in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in his Temple, and that in-dwelling is not onely of the Gifts, but also of the person of the Holy Ghost; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghost is more than the Gifts or Efficacy of God: when I speak of a personall in-dwelling of the Holy Ghost in the Regenerate, you must not conceive that thereby he doth make us one Person with himself, or that he doth communicate unto us any personall or divine Propriety of his own (for that is incommunicable) but that the Holy Ghost, who, as God is every where, is present in the Elect with his own gifts in an admirable manner to enlighten, and streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, to establish and quicken, to govern and lead them, to seale and witnesse with them their spirituall state and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: This is evident by these Scriptures: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. <hi>The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given to us:</hi> The sense of Gods love, like a precious Oyntment, is shed abroad in our hearts, causing us to feele that we are beloved of God.

So <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16, 17. that promised Comforter, which proceedeth from the Father, is the Holy Ghost himself; and of him Christ sayes, <hi>That he shall abide with you, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</hi>

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:205094:83"/>Ghost, which dwelleth in us:</hi> That good thing is fitly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood the precious Treasure of sound and wholsom Doctrine, which is committed to thy trust, to be preserved and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to others; and withall, the Talent of those Gifts and Graces,<note place="margin">1 Tim 6.20.</note> wherewith <hi>Timothy</hi> was furnished for discharge of his office; which Trust, though it be hard to keep, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring what oppositions of Science it meets withall, yet the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is mighty, enduing us with power to keep it; the Holy Ghosts that keepeth the good gifts of Grace in us, and enableth us to performe the Trust committed unto us, is not the gifts, but the Person of the Holy Ghost distinct from them, and this Holy Ghost is said <hi>to dwell in us</hi> for that purpose. Having thus dispelled that thick Mist wherewith the <hi>Socinians</hi> strive to obscure the cleare truth of God, I shall more briefly dispatch my other reasons, which prove the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>My third Argument is taken from that honour and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship which is given to him in Scripture. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> Mat. 28.19. <hi>Baptise them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</hi> Baptism is a part of Divine worship. To be <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into one's Name</hi> doth signifie that we are consecrated to his worship and service, to put our trust in him for salvation, and remission of sins: Now we are not baptised into the name of a Gift; it must be a Person, and that Person must be God too; for it is a sin to be baptized into the name of <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.13.</note> or any other Creature, which cannot forgive sins, neither ought to be worshipped: And seeing the Holy Ghost is joyned with the Father, and the Son in this divine Honour and Worship, therefore also in the fellowship of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head. Were it not a grosse injury to the Text to read the words thus, <hi>Baptize them in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Vertue of the Father?</hi> For the Father being named, the Efficacy, or Vertue of the Father is included, and it were altogether vain to repeat one Person twice in three words.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Again the Apostle prayes to the Holy Ghost, and blesseth the Church in the name of the Holy Ghost, 2 Cor. 13.13. <hi>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:205094:83"/>Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost be with you all:</hi> Here the Holy Ghost is invocated for a blessing in like sort, as the Father and the Son are, therefore he is God with them: <hi>Paul</hi> prayes to all three, and acknowledgeth a Power in them all, to blesse the <hi>Corinthians</hi> unto eternity. By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the Holy Ghost, we come to be partakers of the grace of Christ, and the love of the Father: and if we have the love of God, and the merits of the Son made ours by the comfortable presence and operation of the Holy Ghost, then we are a blessed people indeed: The Father loves us, and gave us his Son, the Son redeems and justifies us freely by his grace; the Holy Ghost communicates and sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to us both the love of the Father, &amp; the merit of his Son.</p>
                  <p>In these three things the Salvation of mankind doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, which are all comprehended in this Apostolicall Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction: Look from whom Grace is wished,<note place="margin">Revel. 1.4, 5.</note> and in whose name the Church is blessed, the same is God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, An Oath is a part of Divine worship, and the Apostle (<hi>Rom.</hi> 9.1) doth attest the Holy Ghost as a witnesse of the truth of this his Oath or Asseveration, <hi>I say the truth in Christ, my Conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost.</hi> The Church of God in all ages hath worshipped the Holy Ghost; in our Creed we professe our Faith in him, and in that Doxologie, worthy to be retained in the Churches, <hi>Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Ghost, world without end;</hi> and all that be not Hereticks will say <hi>Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My fourth Reason is taken from certain divine Properties, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>4</label> which are ascribed to the Holy Ghost: As</p>
                  <p>First, That he is <hi>immensus &amp; ubique,</hi> in all places at once. Psal. 139.7. <hi>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit, or whither shall I flie from thy Presence?</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his;</hi> therefore he is infinite, and in ten thousand places at once; every Creature is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by its Nature, but the Holy Ghost hath a Nature not circumscribed, therefore he is not a Creature, but a God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Holy Ghost is <hi>omniscient,</hi> and knoweth all
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:205094:84"/>things,<note place="margin">Acts 1.24. Acts 5.2, 3. Rom. 8.16.</note> even the secrets of hearts, else he could not <hi>beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse with our spirits, that we are the Children of God;</hi> else he could not <hi>beare witnesse with</hi> Paul<hi>'s Conscience,</hi> of the truth of his <hi>inward affection</hi> to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.10.</note> Rom. 9.7. Else he could not <hi>reveale</hi> and <hi>search all things,</hi> yea, <hi>the deep things of God.</hi> Else he could not <hi>lead the Apostles into all truth,</hi> John 16.13.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is <hi>omnipotent;</hi> else he could not enable the Apostles to work miracles. The <hi>Gospel</hi> was spread <hi>through mighty signes and wonders by the power of the spirit of God,</hi> Rom. 15.19.</p>
                  <p>My fifth is taken from the punishment of those that sin against the Holy Ghost. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>5</label> Mat. 12.31, 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </label> by comparing 3 places of Scripture together; the first is that of <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.29, 30. <hi>He that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenesse, but is in danger of eternall damnation, because they said he hath an unclean spirit.</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>à laedenda famâ, &amp; existimatione alicujus,</hi> and so to blaspheme the Holy Ghost, is to cast reproaches on him.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:205094:84"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Note the reason why these Scribes are said at this time to blaspheme;<note place="margin">Mat. 12.22.</note> It was because they did ascribe that miracle unto <hi>Belzebub,</hi> which was indeed done by the power of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> ver. 28. by the finger of God: So is the reason here expressed, ver. 30. <hi>because they said, he hath an unclean spirit:</hi> And Mat. 12.32. because <hi>they spake that word against the Holy Ghost.</hi> These Scribes and Pharisees did of malice oppose Christ, and misconstrue his works, casting that reproach upon him, lest the people should acknowledge him to be the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> as appeares by the reasons which Christ useth to convince them of their sensless false accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Christs manner of casting out Devils, was with such hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly majesty and authority,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.28.</note> as that his enemies knew it was <hi>by the spirit of God</hi> (for here our Lord taketh that for granted) saying, <hi>If I cast out Devils by the spirit of God, then is the Kingdome of God come unto you;</hi> and therefore you are mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious opposers of the Kingdome God in my person: So then our Saviours speaking here of the sin against the Holy Ghost, by occasion of their malicious attributing that to Sathan, which they could not but know was the finger of God, doth give us to understand,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dick on</hi> en Mat. 12.32.</note> that this Sin is a wilfull and malicious rejecting and opposing of Jesus Christ, and of the way of salvation by him, after that the Holy Ghost hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned and convicted the party of the salvation offered to the world by Christ: or it is a malicious opposing the truth of the Gospell, made knowne to us by the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>A learned Man correcting the common opinion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines touching this point, doth think that this is it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Baxt. Rest.</hi> part. 2. S. 5.</note> which is called <hi>The Sin against the Holy Ghost; when men will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by miracles, that Jesus is the Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against which definition, I oppose three things:</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.22.</note> That Miracles are not a sole sufficient conviction to beget Faith. The Jews require a sign, and they saw enough, and yet believed not. John 12.37. <hi>For though Christ had done so many miracles before them, yet they believed not on him.</hi> The proper end of Miracles was to bring the minds of men to the marking of the Doctrine, that accompanied them, that
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:205094:85"/>by marking it, the efficacy thereof might lay hold on them, and convert them, which it did in very many; but when God withheld this efficacy, that it inclined not the minde, then the men believed not,<note place="margin">John 6.2, 26.</note> though they saw the Miracles: We read, that when <hi>John</hi> heard in Prison the works of Christ, he sent two of his Disciples,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.</note> and said, <hi>Art thou he, that should come? or doe we look for another?</hi> Jesus answered and said, <hi>Goe and shew John againe those things which you heare and see, The Blinde receive their sight, and the Lame walke, the Lepers are cleansed, and the Deaf heare, the Dead are raised up, and the Poore have the Gospel preached to them.</hi> Christ doth answer <hi>Johns</hi> Message by his Works done; yet because those works alone do not demonstrate him to be the Lord Christ, therefore Christ referres him to those marks which the <hi>Prophets</hi> had <hi>foretold,</hi> that so their belief might be grounded on the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Prophets, not on the Miracles alone; The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Christs Miracles with the holy teaching of the Prophets shewing him to be the <hi>Messiah</hi> that was to come.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Men</hi> (saith he) <hi>will not be convinced:</hi> Will not? It is not in our choice, whether we will be convinced or not: It is in our choice, whether we will hear or not: But if we hear, it is not in our choice, whether the secrets of our hearts shall be made manifest, yea or no. 1 Cor. 14.24, 25. <hi>If all prophesie, and there come in one that believeth not, he is convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of all, and judged of all; And thus the secrets of his heart are made manifest, and so falling down on his face, he will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.4, 5. Mat. 13.15.</note>
                     <hi>and say, that God is in you of a truth.</hi> Many are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced against their wills, as that they shall come to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: they would be ignorant of it, but cannot; they would perswade themselves, that Usury, Sacriledge, killing of Kings, be no sins, but cannot. Others are not convinced, though they desire it; The Heretick useth means to prove his way to be truth; he would perswade himself that he is in the right, but cannot; and therefore the Apostle sayes, he is <hi>self-condemned,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 3 10, 14.</note> because he holds on his way against the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions of his own conscience; it is not in my choice whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I will understand, and remember: These are not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded faculties.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:205094:85"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, I demand, Are Miracles a convincing way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing Jesus Christ? Were the Jews that saw them really convinced, or were they not? If not, then they do not sin against the Holy Ghost, which are not convinced by them;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Baxt</hi> 2. parts pag 236.</note> for (as himself saith) <hi>No man is bound to believe that which was never convincingly revealed:</hi> If they be a convincing means, and if those Jews, which saw Christs Miracles, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally convinced, and yet opposed Christs Kingdome, then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature is capable of sinning against the Holy Ghost, in the way that our Divines have defined that sin (that is) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously, after the knowledge of the Truth: And so did those Jews sin, by the testimony of that very Text, which M. <hi>Baxter</hi> alledgeth for his opinion, namely, John 15.24. <hi>If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had sin; but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father:</hi> They hated Christ, after they had seen and known him. It is not an act incompatible with the rationall soul (as he supposeth) to hate God and Christ,<note place="margin">Iohn 3.20.</note> whom we have seen and known.</p>
                  <p>This wil farther appear by consideration of two other places of Scripture, which I intimated, namely, Heb. 6.4, 6. <hi>It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for those, who were once enlightned, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, if they fall away, to renew them again unto repentance, seeing they crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</hi> Note, it is the unpardonable sin that is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, because their repentance is impossible. Concerning which, I observe two things:</p>
                  <p>First, The venomous nature of it, expressed by these words,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Materiale peccati.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <hi>They crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame,</hi> (that is) as the Jews in crucifying Christ, did count of Christ no better than of a common Malefactor, and put him to shame: so an Apostate from Christs Doctrine, doth put him to the like shame; he doth say in effect, Christ is a Deceiver, his Doctrine is false, his Blood is no better than the blood of a Common Malefactor, he doth allow the Fact of <hi>Judas,</hi> and the Jewes, in crucifying of Christ; and if Christ were upon Earth againe, he would then be
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:205094:86"/>as spitefull an enemy to him as ever the Jewes were.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>
                     </label>
                     <hi>but this does not amount to the sin against the Holy Ghost, for Christ prayed for them that crucified him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 3 17. 1 Cor. 2.8.</note>
                     <hi>and many of them were converted at</hi> Peters <hi>Sermon,</hi> Acts 2.41. <hi>which had been his Betrayers and Murderers. The Scripture sayes,</hi> that through ignorance they did it; for had they known, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory: <hi>Now if they, that crucified Christ at first, did not sin against the Holy Ghost, how can the Apostate so sin, who doth but act the same again?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider therefore the second thing in the Apostate's sin, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> which makes his case worse than the Jews,<note n="2" place="margin">
                        <hi>Formale peccati.</hi>
                     </note> because they put Christ to all this shame, they do him this despight after know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and profession (whereas the Jews never professed nor acknowledged him) to renounce Christ and put him to this shame, after you have been <hi>once enlightned</hi> with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, and <hi>have tasted the heavenly Gift</hi> of Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and some peace of Conscience through hope of the pardon of sins, and <hi>were made partakers of the Holy Ghost,</hi> (that is) of many gifts of the Holy Ghost, ordinary, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and <hi>have tasted the good Word of God,</hi> (that is) have found some sweetnesse in the Word of God, like the stony ground; <hi>and the powers of the world to come,</hi> (that is) have felt, as it were, the joyes of Heaven; if after all this, <hi>you shall fall away,</hi> and cast scorn and contempt upon the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Christ, your case is desperate, there is no hope of your <hi>repentance,</hi> you are <hi>nigh unto cursing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The 3. place is Heb. 10.26, 29. <hi>If we sin wilfully aftert hat we have received the knowledge of the Truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of how much sorer punishment shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despight to the spirit of Grace?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the Apostle speaks of the Sin against the Holy Ghost, which hath done despight to the spirit of Grace, and hath no Sacrifice to purge it. Hereof he forewarns some, who in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of Apostacy, withdrew themselves from Church-Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies.<note place="margin">

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:205094:87"/>from Christianity back again to their former Hostility against Christ, did commit, and so are for ever secluded from mercy, forasmuch as they who wilfully reject and scorn the onely sacrifice of the New Testament, the Blood of the Lord Jesus, and the benefit thereof, there is no other sacrifice nor means left to help such an one.</p>
                  <p>Now the summe of what hath been spoken out of these three places of Scripture, may be thus collected, To blaspheme the Holy Ghost, to cast reproaches upon the means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, ascribing the work of the Holy Ghost to the Devill, to put Christ and his Gospel to an open shame, to set ones self against them as an Adversary, to account basely of Christ, and of his Blood, and of his Covenant, and spitefully to oppose and reject the Holy Spirit in his works of Grace; and all this after knowledge and profession of the Gospell: This is the Sin against the Holy Ghost, and is comprehended in the brief definition, which I laid down, namely, the sin against the Holy Ghost, is a malicious, scornfull reproaching and opposing the truth of the Gospell, made known to us by the Holy Ghost.</p>

                  <p>Now to repell that Temptation, let him for his comfort, know for certain, from the Doctrine delivered, and ponder well these five particulars:</p>
                  <p>First, That Infidels, and ignorant Persons, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> do not commit the sin against the Holy Ghost, though they do maliciously blaspheme and persecute the Truth, as the Heathen Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours did, and the Turks at this day: <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Persecutor,</hi> and a <hi>Blasphemer,</hi> and <hi>injurious;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.13.</note> but (saith he) <hi>I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly, in unbelief.</hi> His Ignorance was not the cause why he obtained mercy, but why he was not utrerly excluded from mercy, (as if he should say) if I had done so much against the name of Christ, after knowledge &amp; profession,<note place="margin">Acts 26 9, 11.</note> as I did before in the daies of my ignorance and unbelief, I had never found mercy. But now, though his sin were great, yet not unpardonable, because he did it igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:205094:88"/>The like is to be judged of other spitefull opposers of the Truth, they are not excluded from mercy, if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>
                     </label> and why? because they were never <hi>enlightned,</hi> they never <hi>tasted the good word of God;</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> is set forth as an example and pattern of mercy, and hope to all such as have been enemies to Christ through ignorance and unbelief in that sweet <hi>ver.</hi> 16.<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.16.</note> of 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. <hi>Howbeit, for this cause I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy, that in me, first, Jesus Christ might shew forth all long-suffering for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to everlasting life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Neither does every one that hath sinned against his knowledge and conscience, commit the Sin against the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost: For so did <hi>Peter</hi> sin, in forswearing his Master; so did <hi>David</hi> sin against his knowledge, in the matter of <hi>Ʋrijah;</hi> so did <hi>Adam</hi> sin; and yet they repented, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained mercy, through the sprinkling of the Blood of Christ.</p>
                  <p>The reason is, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>
                     </label> because they fell through force of temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, through weaknesse, not in despite, nor out of ill will, or a base esteem of the Truth; they never were adversaries to the truth which they once professed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Nor is every backslider from the Truth, which once he professed, presently judged to sin against the holy Ghost. In the Primitive times, many, to save their lives, did outwardly deny the knowne Truth, and some in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s dayes did the like, who yet afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and became blessed witnesses to the Truth (as <hi>Cramner,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
                  <p>It was the Error of the Novatians, that if a man, in time of persecution, had denied the Truth, though he repented, yet his sin could not be forgiven, using that speech of our Saviour;<note place="margin">Luke 12.9, 10.</note>

                     <hi>Go and tell</hi> Peter <hi>that I am risen, and I go before you into</hi> Galilee, <hi>and there ye shall see me,</hi> he that denied me as well as the rest: <hi>Peter</hi> had need of spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall comfort, therefore go and tell <hi>Peter:</hi> Thus God sends a message of Peace to the lapsed troubled Soule, Tell such a man or such a woman, <hi>I am the Lord, the Lord gracious and mercifull, long-suffering, abundant in goodnesse and truth;</hi> tell him, <hi>I the Lord will love thee frely, and heal thy back-slidings,</hi> Hos. 14.4. <hi>Spira</hi> denied some Articles of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, through feare of death, and losse of his estate, how the Lord dealt with him, as touching his finall and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting condition, it is not for me to judge: yet considering his temptations and fears, I conceive he sinned not against the holy Ghost; howbeit, it pleased the Lord to make him a sad spectacle of his displeasure, to let others see what a fearfull thing it is to deny Christ and his Gospel before men for any respect whatsoever, and so our Apostle intending to arm and strengthen the persecuted Hebrews against falling away, doth set before them the danger of <hi>forsaking the truth</hi> upon any occasion whatsoever: (<hi>Heb.</hi> 10.27.) And surely if men did foresee their own danger before they fall, as they do feele the terrour of it afterwards; All the terrours in the world, nor all the allurements thereof would prevaile with them to renounce the least point of true Religion and godlinesse. <hi>He that loveth his life shall lose it, and he that hateth his life in this world, shall keep it unto life eternall,</hi> Joh. 12.25.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Nor are we to think, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> that there are certain gross and hainous sins, which cannot be forgiven, though the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners repent never so bitterly for them: All the grievous sins committed by all men in the world, against the Law of God, if they were met in one soul, do not amount to the sin against the holy Ghost; they are pardonable, and have been pardoned in several persons.</p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="tcp:205094:89"/>
                  <p>The reason is, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>
                     </label> because the Promises of the Gospell except no sorts of Sins, and the sufficiency of Christs satisfaction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds all the Sins of all the world. They that were the Betraiers and <hi>Murderers</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2.23, 37, 38. Acts 26.11.</note> were converted at <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, and saved. <hi>Paul</hi> was a <hi>Blsphemer,</hi> yea, he caused others to <hi>blaspheme,</hi> yet he obtained mercy: <hi>Spira</hi> blasphemed God, in saying <hi>I would I were above God; for I know he will not have mercy on me:</hi> And what sin can be greater than Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy?<note place="margin">Mat. 12.31.</note> Yet the Text sayes, that <hi>all manner of Sin and Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy against God shall be forgiven unto men</hi> upon their <hi>repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> this onely <hi>against the holy Ghost</hi> excepted, and that is excepted, because there is no means left to bring them to repentance, and so their sinne is incurable and unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> It is a sure sign, that ye have not sinned against the holy Ghost, so long as your soule mourneth after Christ, and loveth Jesus Christ, and will not quit him, nor his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, and cannot endure to think of a separation from him, but are using all means to recover peace with God: so long as it is thus with any of you, you have not sinned against the holy Ghost; although to your perplexed and amazed spirits, and even despairing soules, by reason of the present sense of wrath, it may be born in against you by Sathan, that you are past recovery and hope of mercy: yet indeed, and in Gods esteem, you are not among Christs adversaries, but reckoned among his friends and lovers; the accusation of your own conscience in this case is not to be taken against the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Scripture, which saith, that <hi>Christ is a Prince exalted to give repentance and remission of sins unto</hi> Israel, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. He that giveth repentance, declareth his purpose to give remission also.<note place="margin">Heb. 6.6.</note> The <hi>Apostate from Christ</hi> cannot be <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> because he cannot be <hi>renew'd again unto repentance,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you be renewed again unto repentance, your salvation is certain. This I have given in caution upon this point, lest any falling grievously, should despair upon this conceit, That it is in vain to pray, or to repent, and seek Gods face, seeing by those very motions and desires, you are evidenced, not to have sinned against the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:205094:89"/>
                  <p>The second use is for Terrour to two sorts: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>2</label> First To all bold and presumptuous sinners, scoffers, and despisers, who, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Terror. </seg>1</label> like Swine, trample under foot the precious Word of Grace, scorn the instructions thereof, and resist the inward motions of the Spirit, which strive to bring them off from the waies of death and ungodlinesse. It is a dangerous matter to oppose Christ and his Gospel, to scoff, and scorn, and jest at it, and to speak ill of the work of Grace in his Children, as to ascribe it to the Devil, &amp;c. This sheweth an inward hatred of the holy and good waies of God: whatsoever such persons may think of themselves, I dare affirm it, that if they had lived when Christ did, heard his Sermons, and seen his Miracles, they would have hated him as much as the Jews then did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is the same spite and venome in their spirits against the waies and work of Grace now, and against the Doctrine of Christ, and the Prophets, left upon record in Scripture, as there was in those Jews which killed the Prophets, when they had heard their Sermons, and their Reproofs by word of mouth. O take heed, as you love Salvation, how you harden your selves in Error, and how you do the least despite to the spirit of Grace.</p>
                  <p>The second sort of men are our Church-forsakers, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister-haters; these are men that have been enlightned, and tasted the good and sweetnesse of Gods Word, and publick Ordinances. They have loved our Persons, reverenced our Doctrines and Teaching, acknowledged us the instruments of the work of Grace upon their Soules: Now to see such persons turn scoffers &amp; haters of our Persons and Office, despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers and blasphemous reproachers of our Doctrine, to make a mock at our Preaching, calling us deceivers of the People, <hi>Baal</hi>'s Priests, blind Guides, &amp;c. This is a fearfull falling away from, and opposing of the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, even after knowledge &amp; profession of the Truth: their Apostacy lieth neer to the Sin against the holy Ghost: And methinks the curse of God is upon their Souls; seeing very few of them are <hi>renewed again unto repentance,</hi> but, like <hi>Apostates,</hi>

                  <p>The operations of the holy Ghost may be reduced to two generall heads: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, He is unto us a Spirit of Light, to enlighten our dark mindes with the knowledge of heavenly Truth; he shines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hearts the knowledge of God, of his Will, yea, the deep Mysteries of godlinesse; he also discovers unto us the deep and hidden things of our own hearts, the desperate wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse and deceitfulnesse thereof, the cursed estate that we are in by nature; it convinceth us of our unbelief, security, hypocrifie, false ends and wayes; it informeth us of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:205094:90"/>our duty, and the things which belong to our peace.</p>
                  <p>The second general operation of the holy Spirit, is to kindle in us good motions, holy purposes, thoughts, desires, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and resolutions: There is naturally in the heart of man, much deadnesse and deceitfulnesse, great indisposednesse to the thing that is good, great pronenesse to evill, &amp;c. Now the Spirit kindles in us good motions, and desires, after the best things, remorse for sin, fear of wrath, joy in the hope of mercy, certain excitements to embrace the word of Life. Isa. 30.21. <hi>Thine eares shall heare a voice behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk in it, when ye turn to the right hand or to the left:</hi> God there promiseth an <hi>outward</hi> Teacher, <hi>Thine eyes shall see thy Teachers:</hi> and an <hi>inward</hi> Teacher, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the outward Ministrie: And few there be in the Church, but one time or another doe feele such secret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and suggestions unto holiness; powerfully stirring them up to faith and repentance. Secret compunctions for sin; se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret purposes of becoming new Creatures, sweet delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in drawing nigh unto God, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now in Answer to the question, I say the Spirit is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, when he is not obeyed, when he is resisted, when he is grieved, and opposed in either of these operations by contrary Counsells, lustings and motions, by corrupt reasonings and imaginations, whereby the sweet breathings of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are stifled, and suffered to die within us without fruit.

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:205094:91"/>This is a quenching of the Spirit. It is a shrewd sign of a graceless heart, when men will shun the Light, seek evasions to avoid the stroak of a searching Ministry, when men will not read such Books, nor such Chapters of the Bible, nor hear such Doctrines discoursed of, wherein their own case is han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled or touched; when people are unwilling to be dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all touching their spirituall estate, their opinions and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and seeing a light arising do blow it out, and hide their faces from it.<note place="margin">Mat. 13.15.</note>
                     <hi>Their eyes have they closed, lest they should see, and be converted;</hi> This is one degree of quenching the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>A second degree of quenching the Spirit, as he is a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of light and illumination, is when men go against their knowledge, and depart from the truth. Their first care is not to see the light, for it is a trouble to them; but when that cannot be hid, the next work is to rebel against the Light, like them of whom <hi>Job</hi> speaks,<note place="margin">Job 14.13.</note>
                     <hi>They are of</hi> those <hi>that rebell against the light, they abide not in the paths thereof.</hi> This is a sad case,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> to know well, and do the contrary. <hi>The wrath of God</hi> (sayes <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>is revealed from heaven against all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and unrighteousnesse of men, which hold the Truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse;</hi> who suppresse it, forcing their own minds; they know better than they do: it is an enslaving the Truth by their perversenesse, making it an underling to their lusts, so that she cannot exercise her command over their Consciences and actions.</p>
                  <p>Wretched men and Women, with whom God has dealt graciously in shewing them their misery by nature, and given them a taste and sight of good things, by meanes whereof they had escaped the common sins and pollutions of the world, and the sins of their former ignorance and vanity, and yet contrary to all this Light, forsake the holy Path, and the holy Commandement given unto them, and take liberty to live in the practise of grosse sins; some of covetousnesse, and oppressions, others of wantonness, others of bodily and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall uncleanness, like bruit. Beasts, according as they are led.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.21.</note>
                     <hi>Better had it been never to have known the way of Truth and Righteousnesse, than after they have known it, to turn from
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:205094:91"/>the holy Commandement given unto them; the later end is worse with them than the beginning.</hi> It was bad with them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they knew Christ, while they lived in a state of darkness and ignorance: 'tis worse now, seeing they go against the Light, they have no excuse for their Sin.</p>

                     <hi>Francis Spira</hi>'s Case is worthy to be set before your eyes, he having embraced, by Gods mercy, the Doctrine of Christ, taught by the Protestants, was for this brought before the Pope's Commissioner, and forced to subscribe and seale to a paper containing a Renuntiation of the said points of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Doctrine: Hereupon he fell into a fearfull despairing of Mercy, and could not be comforted:<note place="margin">Relation of <hi>Spira.</hi> p. 49.55.</note> One asked him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did it willingly, or not? <q>That's nothing to the purpose (said he) Christ will not be denied, no not in word, though in heart I never denied him: I knew (said he) that Justification is to be expected by Christ, and I denied and abjured it, to the end I might keep this fraile life from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, and my children from poverty: And now behold, how bitter this life is to me: and God onely knowes what shall become of this my Family; but surely no good is likely to betide them, but rather daily worse and worse, and such a ruine at the length, as that one Stone shall not be left upon another.</q> O 'tis a fearfull sin in any man, to force another to go against his knowledge (as the Pope's Legate here did <hi>Spira.</hi>) <hi>Paul</hi> bewailed it,<note place="margin">Acts 26 11.</note> that he had <hi>compelled</hi> poor Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to <hi>blaspheme:</hi> And it is a fearfull sin to be compelled to quence the light that is in us, for to preserve this frail life from Adversity, and our children from Poverty: He that shall so save his life, shall lose it: God is justly provoked to take his spirit of Grace and Comfort quite away, as he did from <hi>Spira,</hi> who said, That <q>there was never such a specta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, Come we to the second generall operation of the Spirit, as he is a Spirit of holinesse, kindling in us good motions, and holy desires and purposes. And here the Spirit is quenched in us and by us, when he is disobeyed and resisted in his reproofs and admonitions in his guidance, and leading us on to our Conversion, or the exercise of Christian Graces
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:205094:92"/>and Duties. See this Sin, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.30. <hi>Thou testifiedst against them by thy Spirit in thy Prophets, yet would they not give eare.</hi> This Sin is thus set forth also, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.10, 11, 12. <hi>Thus spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Lord of Hosts, saying, Execute true judgement, shew mercy and compassion every man to his Brother, and oppresse not the Widow, nor the Fatherlesse, the Stranger, nor the Poore, and let none of you imagine evil against his Brother in his heart; But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped their eares, that they should not heare, yea, they made their hearts as an Adamant stone, lest they should heare the Law, and the words which the Lord of Hosts hath sent in his Spirit by the former Prophets:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 4.30. Acts 7.51.</note> This is here called <hi>Quenching of the Spirit,</hi> and elsewhere, <hi>Grieving of the Spirit;</hi> and by St. <hi>Stephen, Resisting of the holy Ghost:</hi> When they heard <hi>Stephens</hi> words, <hi>they were cut to the heart, and gnashed on him with their teeth, they stopp'd their eares, and ran upon him with one accord, and stoned him,</hi> ver, 54.57.</p>
                  <p>This Sin is committed usually through carelesnesse, ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and carnality of the heart; many sweet motions and stirrings of the Spirit, die without fruit. There is a spirituall sloth grows upon Christians through the fatnesse of their hearts, by reason whereof, those glowings of thy Conscience, those sparkes of the holy fire, kindled by the Spirit, decay and cool in thee, and become like a coale of fire raked up under a heap of ashes.</p>

                     </label> and let thy Conscience answer to these par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars:</p>
                  <p>How many holy Purposes hast thou had, that never came to the Birth? How many Resolutions never yet fulfilled? How often hast thou been checked, and stirred up to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant course of religious Duties, which yet thou hast not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun? How often has it been in thy heart never to come neer the house of such a light woman, and yet hath broken thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, till a secret wound hath peirced thy heart? How often hath God sent thee such Messages, as <hi>Pilates</hi> Wife sent to him concerning Christ, <hi>Have thou nothing to doe with that just man?</hi> Meddle not in such an unjust action, wind thy self out of such and such State-combinations; get thy foot out
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:205094:92"/>of the snare; keep thy self pure from the blood of all men; joyn not, nor be thou instrumentall in the oppressing and undoing of such and such men; defile not thy self with the sin of Sacriledge, and robbing of Churches; deliver thy soul from unrighteous and cruell men, stand not in their counsels, &amp;c. And yet thou hast baffled thy conscience, and hardned thy heart against all these warnings from Heaven. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny motions and purposes hast thou had on thy waking bed, to make restitution of Lands and Goods ill gotten; to leave off Bribery, false Accusation, Usury, Violence, and Fraud? How often hast thou said I will not suffer the accursed thing, <hi>Achans</hi> Wedge, to be among my stuffe, and yet when thou comest abroad, and seest the courses of the World, thou hast laid it up in thy Tent; though it be as a Canker in thy conscience, and in thy Estate to Posterity? How often has God by his Spirit in the Ministery of his Word, met with thy beloved Sin, and even made thy heart to melt, so that thou hast gone from the Church with a resolution to become a new Man, and yet thou hast suppressed and quelled those holy thoughts and resolutions, by setting up contrary reasonings and imaginations? How many Sermons hast thou struggled withall, and at last got the victory over them, and cast them all out of thy heart and practise? What shifts hast thou used to chase away those qualmes of Conscience? How often hast thou been almost perswaded to be a Christian, and yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perswaded again by some base and vain temptation? How often, at the receiving of the Sacrament, hast thou renewed thy Covenant, and made promises of better Obedience, and yet remainest as vile as ever? Thus thou hast dallied with Repentance, and thy Salvation, despised thy God and his Counsels, refused to be reformed, and quenched the spirit of Grace. I wish thee to remember that sad passage of <hi>Spira</hi>'s:<note place="margin">Relation of <hi>Spira.</hi> p. 56.</note>
                     <hi>I tell you, said he, when at</hi> Venice <hi>I did first abure my professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so, as it were, drew an Indenture, the Spirit of God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten admonished me; and when at</hi> Cittadella, <hi>I did, as it were, set to my Seale, the Spirit of God often suggested unto me, Doe not write,</hi> Spira, <hi>doe not seale; yet I resisted the holy Ghost, and did both; and at that very instant, I did evidently feele a wound
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:205094:93"/>inflicted in my very will; so although I can say, I would believe, yet can I not say, I will believe: O, now I cannot, God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me the power of will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We live in a subscribing age, we must swear and unswear; covenant for the King one while, another while engage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the King: And what multitudes of knowing Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be there, whose Consciences have been enlarged to take in all the points of this compasse? and all to preserve this fraile life from Adversity, and their children from Poverty. O what Reluctancies and Contradictions of your own hearts and consciences have you wrestled with? Hath not the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God often suggested unto thee, as once to <hi>Spira,</hi> Do not engage (with men of <hi>Belial</hi>) Do not subscribe? and yet thou hast done both: What shifts and evasions hath thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull heart studied? What forced senses and salvoes hath it found out to put by all those motions of Gods Spirit? Hast thou not set thy Wit above thy Conscience? and thy Lust, the love of the World, Carnall-self, above them both? And so, as it were, sold thy self to do evill? What wilt thou do? Can thy heart endure, or thy hands be strong, when the Lord shall deal with thee? What terrour will seize on thee, when thy Hand-writing shall be shewed against thy most solemn Oath, and thy Oath against thy Hand-writing? Thou hast sworn, that <hi>the King</hi> is the <hi>onely Supreme,</hi> and that <hi>thou wilt beare faith and true allegiance to him and his Heires:</hi> Thou hast pawned all thy interest in the blessed Book of God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fidelity herein; <hi>So help me God, and the Contents of this Book:</hi> And yet now thou engagest to bear Faith and Truth to them that have taken away the Kings life, and deposed his Posterity.</p>
                  <p>A time of change will come, and then these hidden things shall be brought to light, then it will be made manifest, that thou fearedst Men more than God, and lovedst the present World more than Truth and Righteousness; then it will be made manifest, how many checks and secret impulfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Spirit thou hast out-stood, what pains thou hast ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to blind the world, and craft thou hast used to deceive thy own soul.</p>

                  <p>See this truth proved in five several branches of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion: First, that God did elect and ordain certain Persons to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ, are the expresse words of the Apostle; 1 Thes. 5.9. <hi>God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ:</hi> Then some are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed unto Wrath, and some unto Salvation. There is a separation made between men and men.</p>
                  <p>The Church of God is his House; <hi>But in a great house, there are not onely vessels of Gold and Silver, but also of Wood,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.20, Rom. 9.22, 23.</note>
                     <hi>and of Earth, and some to Honour, and some to Dishonour:</hi> So is it in the Church: And who these Persons are in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it is determinately known;<note place="margin">2 Tim 2.19.</note>
                     <hi>The Lord knoweth them that are his;</hi> The Lord hath not onely appointed a certain kind of men to be saved (namely) such as shall believe, and obey the Gospel, but who they are by name,<note place="margin">John 13.18.</note> according as it is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13 Jacob <hi>have I loved, but</hi> Esau <hi>have I hated. I know whom I have chosen:</hi> God knows the Elect by their names; for <hi>their names are written in the book of life,</hi> Rev. 13 8. There is a peculiar personall distinction between the Elect and others, with their peculiar priviledges; <hi>All that dwell on the earth shall worship the Beast whose names were not written in the book of Life of the Lamb;</hi> they shall not be deceived, nor overcome by the Beast.<note place="margin">Luke 10.20.</note> So our <hi>Saviour</hi> bids his Disciples <hi>rejoice in this, because your names are written in Heaven.</hi> A comparison taken from the custome in great Cities, to enroll their free Denizons in a book by their names. God does not stand in need of any such Remembrancer as a Book, but that is written for our comfort, that we may rest assured of Gods eternall love to us in particular; and though our names be not written in Scripture, thou <hi>Thomas,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> shalt
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:205094:96"/>be saved, yet they are written in heaven in Gods book of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This choice was made before the foundation of the world.<note place="margin">Rev. 17.8. 2 Tim 1.9.</note>
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. Our <hi>names</hi> were <hi>written in the Lambs book of life,</hi> not when we first came to believe, but <hi>before the world was.</hi> And so our Saviour shall welcome the Elect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Fathers Kingdome, saying, <hi>Come ye blessed of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (blessed of my Father, because the Father chose them to be his Children) <hi>inherite the Kingdome prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</hi> Here Christ gives them pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session in time, but the Kingdome was prepared for them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was. Even as our Heirs do enter upon their Inheritances, when they come to be of Age, though it were purchased for them before they were born.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> They were chosen out of lost mankind. In <hi>Adam</hi> all died, and forfeited that first Covenant; the Lord had mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on some, drawing them out of that corrupted lump, to make us his Children by Christ:<note place="margin">Ephes. 2.3.</note>
                     <hi>We are all of us, by nature, children of wrath, even as others,</hi> we were not so by our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore God of his infinite mercy, did choose us in Christ, and <hi>predestinate us to the adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of children by Jesus Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 3 38.</note> Eph. 1.5. <hi>Adam</hi> was the Son of God, and if he had so continued, we need not to have been predestinated to a new Son-ship by Adoption, but having lost our first Son-ship, and became children of Wrath, God predestinated us to the Adoption of Children by Jesus Christ: Now a predestination in Christ doth presuppose a Fall, or a lapsed and forlorn Estate: Man fallen therefore is the object of divine Predestination.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> God did choose some rather than others, out of his meer good pleasure: There was no cause, motive, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in the party chosen, moving the Lord to choose him and pass by others, But whereas God might have utterly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted all, of his free grace and mercy he had compassion on some. Thus the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5 That he did <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinate us according to the good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace:</hi> If he had chosen some (as <hi>Peter</hi> for example) because he foresaw they would be good, and die in
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:205094:96"/>the Faith; and had refused others (as <hi>Judas</hi>) because he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saw they would be wicked, and obstinate despisers of his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel: This had not been an act of Grace, it had not set forth the glory of that Attribute, but rather of his distributive Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. But that which God mainly intended in this free choice, was the praise of the glory of his Grace, that man should find nothing to admire, or boast in, but in the rich grace of God. And of this free choice, <hi>Paul</hi> gives instance in <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau.</hi> Rom. 9.11. <hi>The children being not yet born, neither having done good or Evill, that the purpose of God, according to election, might stand, not of works, but of him that calleth: It was said, the elder shall serve the younger,</hi> Jacob <hi>have I loved,</hi> Esau <hi>have I hated.</hi> These two brethren were every way equall before the Lord, as the Clay before the Potter; and the difference between them stood not in works which the one had done, or should do, more than the other, but in the will of God, who <hi>hath mercy on whom he will have mercy,</hi> ver. 15.17. and <hi>whom he will, he hardeneth;</hi> on the one he shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the <hi>riches of his glory,</hi> on the other his <hi>just wrath,</hi> v. 22, 23. So then it remaineth a sure truth, that <hi>we are predestinated according to the purpose of him, who worketh all things after the counsell of his own will,</hi> Eph. 1.11. He taketh counsel from none other, he goes not out of himself for a reason of this his doing, but his purpose stands upon the counsel of his own will.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, and lastly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> He passeth by others to perish in their sins, to the glory of his Justice and Power:<note place="margin">Rom 9.22.</note> In the Reprobate God doth shew Justice and his Power.</p>
                  <p>First, His Power and Soveraignty in not shewing mercy on them as well as on the Elect, who were in the same lump of misery: And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, His Justice, because in the party non elected, or passed by, there is enough to condemn him, so that the Lord doth freely, yet justly, reject them: In <hi>Esau</hi> God saw enough to hate him, there was his Justice; yet that he did hate him rather than <hi>Jacob,</hi> therein he shewed his free Power: <hi>As the Petter hath power over the Clay of the same lump,</hi> every way the same, <hi>to make one vessel unto honour, and another unto dishonour,</hi> Rom. 9.21.</p>
                  <pb n="170" facs="tcp:205094:97"/>
                  <p>Thus you see our first Conclusion proved, namely, that God hath chosen some unto life, and not others, and what Predestination is.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <p>Now follows our second Conclusion, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Conclus. </seg>2</label> namely, that the Elect, and none but the Elect, shall be saved. That this is a truth, and no lie, is evidenced by four places of Scripture: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he predestinated, them he also called; and whom he also called, them he also justified, and whom he justified, them he also glorified:</hi> The number of the glorified ones does not exceed the number of predestinated ones: <hi>Whom he predestinated, them also he glorified: Hos, non alios;</hi> In that golden chain of Salvation, the first and last links are joyned together by the two middle links: There is such a Concate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of them all, that if ye break one link, the whole chain is broken, and if ye be holden by one link, ye be holden of all, and shall partake of all; these things are reciprocall, and of adequate extent: If it were <hi>hos,</hi> and <hi>alios,</hi> then first it were no advantage to these, <hi>(hos)</hi> that they are predestinate, or just fied, or called; secondly, if others besides the predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate were glorified, then this must be the meaning of the words, Whom he did predestinate, them he also called, and a great many more; and whom he called, them, and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers besides them, he justified, and whom he justified, them, and many besides them, he also glorified: for according to their opinion) many besides the Elect are saved. But will any man that is in his wits dare affirm, that any be glorified, which were never justified? or that any are justified, which were never called? or that any are called, who were never predestinated? This they must affirm, that hold that others besides the predestinate shall be saved: But the demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Article with the copulative, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, being thrice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated <hi>(them also, them also, them also)</hi> must necessarily evince, that these, and none but these, are called, justified, or glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>The next place is <hi>John</hi> 17.9, 10. <hi>I pray for them, I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me out of the world, for they are thine, and all mine are thine, and thine are mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="171" facs="tcp:205094:97"/>
                  <p>Note here four things; First, that there are two sorts of men, some are given to Christ <hi>out of the world,</hi> ver. 6. some are still <hi>in</hi> and <hi>of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, note for what end they are given to Christ, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That he should manifest the name and will of God unto them,</hi> that is, that Christ should redeem them, and fit them for glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>v.</hi> 6.8.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They were thine</hi> (saies Christ) before they were mine; <hi>Thine they were, and thou gavest them me;</hi> Thou hadst a right of propriety in them, and therefore a right to give to me. But how were they thine? How they thine more than the rest of the world? Surely, because they were the Elect of God, thine they were by eternall Election.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, note, that the Elect and the Redeemed are of equall extent, <hi>All thine are mine, and all mine are thine,</hi> as if he should say, as thou hadst made thine Elect members of my Body, to the end that I should redeem them; so I have made them thy Children, that thou mayest own them for thine, by communicating to them the love of friendship; All thine by Election, are mine by Purchase; and because they are mine, therefore they are thine; <hi>You are Christ</hi>'s, <hi>and Christ is God</hi>'s. None but the Elect are given to Christ, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore none but they are saved.</p>
                  <p>The next place is <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.31. At the end of the world <hi>Christ shall send his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet, and they shall gather together his Elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other:</hi> Not one of them shall be lost, or forgotten: But for what end are they gathered? <hi>He shall set them at his right hand,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 25.32, 34.</note>
                     <hi>and sever them from the rest, as a Sheepherd divideth the Sheep from the Goats, and shall say unto them, Come ye blessed Children of my Father, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Kingdome prepared for you.</hi> Here is a blessed gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring unto Christ; but who are thus gathered? They are his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> all his Elect, and none else: And surely, they that are left out of the number of these gather'd ones, shall not be received into the Kingdome of his Father, for it was never prepared for them.</p>
                  <p>My last sort of proofes shall be from those places, which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:205094:98"/>testifie Gods special love in preparing for the Elect the means of salvation, and making the same effectuall to them, which yet are not so to others. When the seaventy returned, and had told our Saviour what good success their preaching had (<hi>Lu.</hi> 10.20, 21.) whereas the Jews repented not at his own prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching and miracles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.20. He breaketh forth into an admiration of Gods love to his despised ones, who believed on him, when wiser than they did not; <hi>I thank thee, O Father of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes:</hi> It does not go by wit, or learning, or strength of naturall parts; but thus it is, <hi>even because it so seemed good in thy sight,</hi> ver. 25, 26. so amongst <hi>Paul</hi>'s hearers, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. Some spake against the things which were spoken by <hi>Paul;</hi> But <hi>as many as were ordained to eternall life, believed:</hi> Gods free and eternal mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ordained the means, as he had the end, eternall life; and withall, he blessed the means unto that end: Those Gentiles were not fitted for eternal life, before they believed, but being fore-ordained to life, they embraced the Word of Life, the means thereunto.</p>
                  <p>But most remarkable to our purpose, is that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11.7. Israel <hi>hath not obtained that which he seeketh for, but the Election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded:</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle having disputed that sad Theme of the Rejection of the Jews, and shewed how their Rejection might well consist with the truth of Gods Promises: He answers that doubt by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing of their persons; there were two sorts of Jews (as of <hi>Abrahams Children</hi>) one <hi>carnall,</hi> the other <hi>spirituall;</hi> there was a <hi>Jew outwardly,</hi> and a <hi>Jew inwardly;</hi> the one <hi>sought righteousnesse</hi> by the <hi>works of the Law,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom 9 32.</note> and <hi>missed</hi> it; the other <hi>sought</hi> it <hi>by Faith,</hi> and <hi>obtained</hi> what they sought; and so the one sort (which were the Body of that Church and State) are rejected, the other, being but a small remnant, or parcell, torn from the rest, are still within the Covenant. But whence proceeds this difference, that some obtained not what they sought, that <hi>Christ</hi> was a <hi>Rock of offence</hi> to some, and <hi>pretious</hi> unto others? The Text tells you, <hi>the Election ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it, the rest were blinded:</hi> This is the Apostles resolution
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:205094:98"/>upon the Question propounded, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Hath God cast away his people? God forbid;</hi> he proves it first in himselfe, <hi>I am a Jew,</hi> therefore all are not cast away, because I am not.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God hath not cast away his people whom he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew,</hi> that is, whom he loved and marked out for his owne from everlasting. Gods approbation of us by reason of our faith, is an after-knowledge,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vostius</hi> Rom. 11.2.</note> and doth follow <hi>in puncto ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> and <hi>in mente divinâ,</hi> an act of mans will; fore-knowledge in this place cannot be expounded by approbation, but it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports as much as fore-ordaining or election.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As in the daies of <hi>Elijah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m. 11.5, 6.</note> God had <hi>reserved</hi> a people from the common <hi>defection</hi> of those times, <hi>even so at this time there is a remnant;</hi> How so? <hi>According to the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Grace,</hi> not whereby Men choose Grace, but whereby God chooseth us of his meer grace and mercy, it follows <hi>ver.</hi> 7. What then? Let us draw to some conclusion: How stands the matter? Thus it stands, and this is the conclusion, <hi>The Election hath obtained it,</hi> that is, Life and Righteousness, <hi>and the rest were blinded.</hi> Let men sweat out their brains, this must be yeilded; The Elect have a preheminence above the rest, they obtained it, the rest were blinded.</p>
                  <p>Out of these Scriptures laid together, it is clear: First, that when several persons hear the same Sermons, see the same Miracles, enjoy the same Doctrine, and means of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet to some it proves a savour of life, a converting word, to others, a rock of offence. Secondly, that the God of grace doth <hi>shine into their hearts,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.4, 6.</note>
                     <hi>the light o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jesus Christ;</hi> But <hi>the God of this world hath blinded the mindes of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ should shine unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hence our Argument may be thus gathered, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> None are sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but they to whom the means of grace are made effectual to their conversion; but the Elect onely are thus effectually wrought upon, Therefore they onely are saved; and we that preach this Doctrine, are not notable Liars, but the faithfull Witnesses of God.</p>

                  <p>First, That this Doctrine tells no man in particular, who is elected, or who rejected; we cannot tell who are Reprobates, nay, no man can know himselfe to be a Reprobate, for his Sins are not above Gods Grace: God can change his heart, even when he is breathing out curses and threatnings against the name of Christ,<note place="margin">Acts 9.</note> as he did <hi>Paul</hi>'s; God is above thy naughty heart, and he can change it at the ninth, or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:205094:99"/>or at the last hour of the day. No man can know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a Reprobate, and therefore we preach the Gospel to Men, as Sinners, not as Elect, or Reprobate, to all Sinners without exception, to the greatest of Sinners, we bid them <hi>come unto Christ,</hi> and he will <hi>refresh</hi> and <hi>heale</hi> them:<note place="margin">Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

The last Clause of the 17 Article before mentioned, is very weighty to this purpose, the words are these, <hi>We must receive Gods promises in such wise, as they be generally set forth unto us in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture; and in our doings, that will of God is to be followed, which we have expressely declared unto us in the word of God:</hi> and that will of God is,<note place="margin">John 6.37, 40.</note> that we <hi>preach the Gospell to every Creature;</hi> and that every Creature may <hi>come to Christ,</hi> and <hi>drinke of the water of life freely,</hi> and that <hi>whosoever cometh unto him, he will in no wise cast out.</hi> Praying, and Preaching, and Seeking are not in vain, for <hi>every one that seeketh findeth, and he that asketh receiveth, and to him that knocketh it shall be opened,</hi> Luke 11.9, 10.

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:205094:100"/>We must look at Gods revealed will, that we should pray and wait on him in his waies:<note place="margin">Acts 8.22.</note>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> bade <hi>Simon Magus pray:</hi> In preaching the Gospel, light, motion and power, goes out to all, which they that resist are destroyed, not because they could not believe, but because they resist, and will not obey; Gods election takes no man off from duty.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer, That the Gospel was, and is, intended onely for the Elect, although many Reprobates do enjoy the ministration thereof, and many outward blessings, because they are mingled in the world with the Elect, to whom one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is directed (as <hi>Judas</hi> was among the Apostles.) This I take to be clear from the Scripture, which saith, that the <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wisdome</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in the Mysterie of the Gospel, was <hi>ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto our glory</hi> (that is) to our glorification, that by the knowledge thereof, Gods people might obtain celestial glory, (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.) But most plain &amp; full is that of 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.9, 10. where he saith, that the Doctrine which he taught, and the Afflictions which he indured in defence of it, were intended for the Elects sake, <hi>I endure all things for the Elects sake, that they may obtain the salvation which is in Jesus Christ:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 18.10.</note> All that he did, or suffered, was for the furthering of the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Gods Elect. God gave this reason why <hi>Paul</hi> should preach at <hi>Corinth</hi> in despight of all opposition, <hi>because I have much people in this City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the like reason I suppose it may be gathered, that where God hath no people, there shall be no preaching and where he removes his Candlestick, it is a sad sign that he hath no people in that place: The Gospel is preached to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate accidentally onely, neither does the Lord seek any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against them by it, he needs it not, he has enough against them for violating that first Covenant. See this <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.17. <hi>God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved.</hi> This our Saviour proves by a dis-junction, <hi>ver.</hi> 18 Thus all the world is distributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to two sorts, they are either Believers or Unbelievers: Christ came not to condemn Believers, for <hi>he that believeth on him is not condemned:</hi> Nor did he come to condemn them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not, for <hi>he that believeth not is condemned already,</hi> to wit,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:205094:100"/>by the sentence of the Law, <hi>Cursed is every one that sinneth,</hi> so that Christ should not need to come into the world to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it; God needs not seek any further matter of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation against them, we do not go to any Reprobate, and say to him, Believe in Jesus Christ, but we preach the Gospel to all sinners, because, for ought we know, all that hear us may be saved.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This Doctrine is no hindrance unto Piety, nor unto Christian endeavours after Grace and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as will appeare to any one, that shall consider, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Nature of Gods Decree, or the Fruits and Effects thereof.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Nature</hi> of it: Gods Decree is not a simple, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, peremptory ordaining of an End without Means, but together with the End he decrees and ordains the Means thereunto; therefore it is said, that <hi>we are chosen in Christ,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 1.4, 5.</note>
                     <hi>and predestinated to the adoption of Children by Jesus Christ, according to the good pleasure of his will,</hi> that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> or good pleasure of his will, doth include Christ; and so the act of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destination is not absolute, but relative, it is with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Christ; For how can we be predestinated to the Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Children, but in Christ the naturall Son of God? Thus 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2.13. we are said to be <hi>chosen unto salvation through sanctification of the Spirit, and belief of the Truth, whereunto he hath called you by our Gospel.</hi> So doth <hi>Peter</hi> set forth Gods Decree: 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God the Father, through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ:</hi> You see how these things are complex and joyned together, Gods Act choosing us, the end subordinate (Obedience and sprinkling of Christs Blood) ultimate our salvation intended not abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, live how we list, but in and through sanctification and belief of the truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Gods Decree is every way holy, just, and good,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.4.</note> if you consider the Effects and <hi>Fruits</hi> of it, He hath chosen us, that we should be holy and without blame before him in love: So the Apostle describes an elect Vessel: 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 2.21. <hi>If a man purge himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:205094:101"/>sanctified, and meet for the Masters use, and prepared unto eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work:</hi> The Elect are not a prophane, barren, unclean, fruitless kind of men, good for nothing; but sanctified, and fruitfull in good works. S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it a sign of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Because they received the Gospel, not onely in word, but in power, and in the holy Ghost, and in much assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Lastly, S. <hi>Peter</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10.) shews how we may <hi>make our calling and election sure</hi> to our own souls (namely) <hi>if we do these things,</hi> which he mentioneth, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6, 7.</p>
                  <p>From these considerations I thus argue, That Doctrine, which teacheth men to get the knowledge of their election by good works, which teacheth, that the Elect depart from ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, who receive the Word of God in power, and obey it, and live holily and unblamably, and that all this is according to the purpose of Gods Decree, from whence it flowes, as from a fountain: This Doctrine, I say, doth mightily encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and provoke unto Piety, and to all holy and godly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours. But such is the Doctrine of Predestination, as it is taught by us; therefore they are injurious to God and his truth, who cast their contempt of Religion, and their wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched pretences of laziness and loosness upon Gods Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. See it in two particulars:</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">Predestination a sput to g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse to the unconverted.</note> This Doctrine soberly taught and preached, is a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular encouragement to them that be as yet unconverted, to labour for holiness. The Lord freely offereth mercy and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in Christ, if I will but forsake my sins; he assures me, that if I seek and strive, I shall not seek in vain: he waits that he may be mercifull unto me. The Gospel assureth me, that though my present walking does lead to the chambers of Death, yet it doth not conclude, that my reprobation is sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: God doth still call after me, and by the means of grace (which are a part of Predestination unto life) I am assured, that it is not in vain to take pains about my salvation; where means were used, the end will be obtained; <hi>Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousnesse, for they shall be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied.</hi> The Gospel assureth me, that if I receive the Word in power, and give it a divine authority over my Conscience,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:205094:101"/>if I depart from iniquity, and labour to be holy, that then I have in my own bosom the seals of mine Election, that I am a vessel of Honour, that if I obey Gods Call, I may know that I was predestinated, and shall be glorified.</p>
                  <p>Hence I thus reason with my selfe, Is not the favour of God, and knowledge of my Election unto life, worth all these paines that I shall take in the duties of Religion, to attain it? And all those sweet and pleasant sinnes which I am to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quish for it? If I live in them, will they recompence the losse of my Soule? of my God? of eternal Glory? Shall I for worldly advantages to my self or children, be contented to endure eternall torments? Is there not much more sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in the peace of a pure Conscience, washed and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified in the blood of Christ, than in all the Worlds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments?</p>
                  <p>The proper result of such a Consultation, and the proper consequence upon such Principles, is this, I will strive to be holy, to purifie my Conscience from all iniquity, for by that I know I am elected, that I am a vessel of mercy, &amp; shall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified: I will give all diligence to make my calling and election sure, for I know I shall not lose my labour, I shall never fall: <hi>Sarah Wight</hi> said she was sure to be damned, so said Mrs. <hi>Honiwood;</hi> but they were both of them safe in the everlasting armes of the Almighty; for they were holy, they hated Sin, and loved Godlinesse: I henceforth abhorre and detest that mad reasoning, if you be elected you shall be saved, live how you list; if not elected, do what you can, you shall not be saved; for they which do what they can are not reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and they which live holily are elected: What stronger motive than this unto piety and holy endeavours, can be set before an unconverted man?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods Election preached to Believers,<note place="margin">And to them that be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy converted.</note> is unto them the strongest bond of Holinesse and Religion; and that three waies especially.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is a sure rock of Consolation, because they see them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in Gods everlasting armes, in the book of their purified Consciences, they read their names written in the book of Life, they comfort themselves in this, that the Lord knoweth
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:205094:102"/>them that are his, and his foundation is sure, not one of them is lost: it doth greatly establish and confirme their faith of eternall salvation to be enjoyed through Christ.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It doth fervently kindle their love towards God, who loved them first with such a free, undeserved, everlasting love; How does this ravish the soul of the Believer, when he remembreth how God did set his love upon him, before he was, how he hath pitied him in his blood, followed him with his grace, not suffering him to perish, though he himself were unwilling to return; what a weight of glory God hath prepared for him in heaven for evermore! This unconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable Love doth yet more enflame our hearts with love to him again, when we consider, that he hath done all this for us, rather than for others, which were in the same con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation with us. He chose us, and passed by many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands, every way as good as our selves; there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in us that could move him, but <hi>the good pleasure of his owne Will,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 1.5, 6, 7.</note> and <hi>the riches of Grace:</hi> Here is a glorious Grace, here is the riches of Grace, never sufficiently admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, never sufficiently magnified by us; whereupon the soul of the Believer is filled with praises of the Lord: O what am I, that the Lord should be thus mindfull of me? O what shall I render unto the Lord for all the riches of his mercy on my soul, when as he might have glorified his Justice on me as a vessel of wrath? This draweth up the Believers mind to high and heavenly resolutions, they count nothing dear to them for Gods sake, who thus loved them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It makes them carefull to walk with God, to walk wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of him, to embrace and hold fast all those blessed means, by which God hath decreed to bring us to himself, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus Piety is advanced, holy Endeavours encouraged by this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, both in them that believe, and in them that are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted: But neither is God, nor Christ, nor Mans salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, denied by this Doctrine, as is falsly charged by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary.</p>

                     </label> The infiniteness of Gods love is not measured by the Object. For if all men in the world were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to mercy, his love were nevertheless infinite, because all Creatures are but a finite Object: but <hi>infinite</hi> is that which is not bounded, nor hath any limits; and so Gods love in choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a few, is infinite three manner of waies.</p>
                  <p>First, In regard of time; it is without beginning or ending,<note place="margin">Gods love is infinite<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ee manner of waies.</note> it is from everlasting to everlasting.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In regard of the Efficacie put forth, to save, though but a few, though but one soul, requires an infinite price,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.19.</note> the <hi>precious blood of Christ</hi> to satisfie an infinite Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty that was offended, an infinite power to raise dead souls, and dead bodies: <hi>Ephesians</hi> 2.4, 5. <hi>God who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sinnes, hath quickned us together with Christ.</hi> Mans love is bounded, partly by the finiteness of our nature, partly by outward hinderances; we cannot pleasure, or help a friend that is absent, or in the hands of a powerfull Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or in the Sea, out of our reach or knowledge, though we loved him never so dearly. But nothing can hinder Gods love, he hath mercy on whom he will; if he will have mercy, nothing can hinder it, because it is infinite in working, above all inward indisposednesse, or outward operation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is infinite in regard of its Fountain, and the extent of it, and the means of putting it self forth;<note place="margin">John 3.16. Phil. 2.8.</note> it was an infinite love in God, to give his Son, his onely Son, the Son of his love, to become a curse and a reproach, to save, not friends, but enemies that hated him. <hi>In this was manifested the love of God towards us, because he sent his onely begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him: Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.9, 10. This love is so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense, that it cannot be comprehended, as it is in it self.<note place="margin">Eph. 3.18.</note> It is without <hi>breadth,</hi> or <hi>length,</hi> or <hi>depth,</hi> or <hi>height;</hi> ye cannot fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thome the bottome of it, nor reach the height of it, nor find out the breadth of it; when you have seen as far as you can, a new Horizon appeareth; it is yet farther than you see, there is no end of his goodness, and you shall live in the length of it, but never come to the end of it.</p>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:205094:103"/>
                  <p>Now therefore it is a false inference to say, if the love of God be limited to a few, it is farre from being infinite. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se be his holy Name for his infinite love to my one poore soule! my soule, blesse thou the Lord for the <hi>depth</hi> of his love,<note place="margin">Deut. 7.7, 8.</note> for <hi>he loved thee, because he loved thee;</hi> his Love, and the grounds of it, are unsearchable, past finding out!

                     <hi>Absolutely</hi> in themselves, as Objects presented before the Lord to be disposed of, either in a way of Mercy or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice; and then we say, that Gods Act, electing unto Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth not exclude Christ, it doth not absolutely intend the end, Glory, but with relation unto Christ, in whom we are chosen, by whom, and with whom, we are glorified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. So for Gods Act reprobating, we say, that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected none but sinners; and for sin, we do not hold, that God would have men to perish, becauve it is his will, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their sins. The ground of this Assertion, is this, <hi>(Quaecunque Deus in tempore facit, ea ab aeterno decrevit fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere)</hi> Look what men, and by what means, the Lord doth in time,<note place="margin">Acts 15.18.</note> actually save, or condemn; the same men, and by the same means, did he from everlasting, determine to save or to condemn; and therefore seeing in time God doth actually save in, and by, and for Christ, those onely which believe in him, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Rule. </seg>
                     </label> therefore such he decreed to save; and seeing in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of his wrath, he doth condemn none but sinners, and for sin, therefore he decreed none but such to be damned; Gods proceeding in the execution, doth manifest what was his purpose and intention from everlasting.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, consider the Persons elected or rejected <hi>comparatively,</hi> comparing the one with the other, and then we say, that they are both alike before God; God doth not choose <hi>Jacob,</hi> or <hi>Peter</hi> for any goodness that he saw in them, more than in <hi>Esau</hi> or <hi>Judas:</hi> neither does he reprobate <hi>Esau</hi> or <hi>Judas</hi> for any wickedness, or unbelief that is in them, more
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:205094:104"/>than in the other, but being both in the same condemnation, he chooseth one, and refuseth another, even because he will, according to the good pleasure of his will. This shall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved anon.</p>
                  <p>But let us first go over again the severall branches of this distinction, for the better explanation and confirmation of the same. In the first Branch of this distinction there are two distinct things affirmed:</p>
                  <p>First, That Gods Act electing unto salvation,<note place="margin">1st. Branch of our distinction hath this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position.</note> is with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence unto Christ; God did decree to save of lost mankind, those which should believe in his Son; I do not say that he did choose them because they believed in his Son; for amongst the lost Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> where shall he find such Faith? In the lost Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> there can be no cause, or motive, why God should have mercy on them,<note place="margin">Titus 3 4.</note> but onely his own infinite gracious disposition, which moved him to shew mercy where none was due. There is this difference between the degrees of Election and Reprobation; of Reprobation we may say, that the damnation, whereunto the wicked are adjudged, is for their sins; but of Election, we cannot say, that the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, unto which they are chosen, is for their goodnesse; if ye seek a cause why God shewed mercy on them, you shall seek and not find, for it is wholly of free grace, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of any goodness that God foresaw in us.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Daven. determ.</hi> q. 26. p. 120.</note>
                     <hi>Quo spectavit Deus in toto hoc negotio praedestinationis, nisi ut gloriam suam illustraret per modum parcentis misericordiae erga electos, &amp; vindicantis justitiae erga reprobatos?</hi> Why God should give Christ unto us, no reason can be rendred,<note place="margin">John 3.16.</note> but because <hi>he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved us:</hi> Why he shewed mercy upon any one at all of the lost Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> nothing moved him but his own infinite goodness.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, Why he did choose some, and pass by others in the same condition, of sin and misery, no reason can be rendred, but his own will, for he hath mercy on whom he will: in the whole business of Predestination, God aimed at this (namely) in the one sort, to shew the glory <hi>parcentis misericordiae,</hi> of his sparing, pitying mercy; in the other sort, the glory of his punishing Justice,<note place="margin">Titus 3.4.</note>
                     <hi>when the kindnesse and love of God towards
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:205094:105"/>Man appeared;</hi> that which was long hid in God did now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, and by that which appeared, we know what was hid, and what that is, see <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>He saved us, not by works of righteousnesse, which we had done, but according to his mercy.</hi>

Christ is the head and foundation of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, in whom are prepared and disposed all saving mercies, which in due time are actually bestowed on them; Gods grace is not communicated to us immediately, but in, and through Christ; if there were no Christ, there would be no Election of us: God hath loved us, and given his Son to us (first) and (then) us unto his Son;<note place="margin">John 17.6.</note>
                     <hi>Thine they were, and thou gavest them me.</hi> Gods Act electing hath reference to Christ two manner of waies.</p>
                  <p>First, Christ is ordained Head of a new Body, or race of Men (opposite to the first, whereof <hi>Adam</hi> was head, <hi>in whom all men have sinned,</hi>

                     <hi>and are dead</hi>) which God by his Election from everlasting, framed and appointed, that in him they might all be gathered together, and by him made partakers of his Grace, Life and Glory. This Decree God brings to pass in due time, bestowing all his favours upon his Church in their sacred Communion with Christ:<note place="margin">Davenant. ubi supra.</note>
                     <hi>He hath chosen us in Christ,</hi> is, as if he had said, <hi>Nos planè perditos in primo Adamo, per praedestinationem donatos fuisse secundo, ut in eo, ac per eum Dei favorem &amp; vitam aeternam consequeremur: Christus ipse praedestinatur incarnandus, &amp; miser is atque lapsis in redempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem mittendus, &amp; in hoc incarnando Dei Filio homines praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nati fuerunt ad vitam;</hi> We were presented unto God, as lost in our first Head, <hi>Adam;</hi> therefore God gave a second Head, Christ Jesus. But where be his Members, seeing none can descend from Christ by propagation? God makes them by Election; God predestinated us to the Adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Jesus Christ; he chose us out of lost Mankind, and gave us to his own Son, to be made Sons by our Communion with him.</p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:205094:105"/>
                  <p>Now although we know little of the order of Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, by reason of our narrow understandings, and therefore it is not fit to move disputes thereupon; yet I conceive that they mistake, who think that God did first predestinate to life a certain number of men, and then by occasion of them, did ordain Christ, onely as the subordinate means of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Decree, my opinion hereof is grounded on these Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. <hi>God did predestinate us to be conformed to the Image of his Son.</hi> Now seeing Christ is the pattern, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which we are predestinated to be conformed, it must needs be that the pattern is first formed, and then they that are fashioned according to the pattern. Again, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.5. it is said, <hi>We are predestinated unto the Adoption of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by Jesus Christ.</hi> Our Adoption unto Son-ship is in the naturall Son; Christ is the naturall Heir,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.17.</note> we are Joynt-heirs with Christ: This is the order, <hi>I goe to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God;</hi> Christ is the first beloved, and we second beloveds. Christ is <hi>the Image of the invisible God, the first-born of every Creature,</hi> and <hi>he is before all things,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1.3, 4.</note> and he is <hi>the Head of the Body, the Church,</hi> Col. 1.15, 17, 18. we are <hi>blessed in Christ;</hi> even as he hath God for his God by Covenant, so we have this blessing of Election in Christ, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as the Head and first Elect, after whom, and in whom, all his Members (for order of Nature) are elected.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We are chosen in Christ, as Mediator; for Gods purpose of giving eternall life, doth presuppose a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of giving a Mediatour, and his purpose of giving a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, doth presuppose an intention of satisfying his Justice for the Sins of his Elect, that so his love might justly save, and his giving of a Mediatour to satisfie his Justice for the Sins of his Elect, doth presuppose a good will and intention to save them; for it was an infinite love to mankind, when as it was not in the wit or power of man to satisfie for one soul, that God should provide a price out of his own store: His meer love gave Christ to us, the same love gave us to Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see what reference Gods Act electing hath unto Christ: He hath chosen us in Christ, as our Head, and we
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:205094:106"/>Members to be conformed to him, and as Mediatour to make way for his love;<note place="margin">1 Thes. 5.9.</note> for <hi>he hath appointed us, not unto wrath but to obtain salvation by Jesus Christ;</hi> so then that word (<hi>in him</hi>) to choose us <hi>in him,</hi> doth not note the state of the person chosen, as if he were actually existing in Christ by Faith, when he is chosen: or as if his Faith were a condition to make him eligible, for Faith is the gift of God; neither doth it imply that Christs satisfaction is the meritorious cause of our electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (for <hi>God loved us when we were enemies,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5.8. Ezek. 16.6. 1 Joh. 4.9, 14.</note>
                     <hi>and chose us in our blood,</hi> and sent his Son to reconcile us to himself.) 2 Corinth. 5.18, 19. <hi>All things are of God, who hath reconciled us to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by Jesus Christ.</hi> God did not elect us, because Christ was sent to die for us; but because God would reconcile us to himself, therefore he sent his Son to die; the sending of his Son is the fruit of Gods love, not the cause thereof, as you shall see more anon.</p>
                  <p>To choose us in him therefore, doth relate to the Act of God electing, not to the Object, about which it is exercised, and so that phrase <hi>(in him)</hi> noteth the <hi>order,</hi> in which we come to be elected, not the <hi>cause</hi> of Election; and it carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this sense; it pleased the Lord of his infinite love and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to lost Mankinde, to appoint Jesus Christ to take our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be an Head and Mediatour to all those whom he should choose out of that state of sin and misery; and because we were not capable of an immediate union with God, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God ordained that all good things, intended and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the love of Election, should be enjoyed by our sacred Communion with him,<note place="margin">Col. 2.3. Ephes. 1.3.</note>
                     <hi>in whom,</hi> as in the store-house of Grace, they are <hi>laid up,</hi> and disposed and <hi>in whom we are bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with all spirituall blessings in heavenly things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This first Branch of our distinction, cuts off all profane conceits about the Decrees of God, in as much as all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect have intimate and sacred Communion with Christ.</p>
                  <p>Now follows the second thing affirmed,<note place="margin">2d. Proposition of the 1st. Branch.</note> in our Distinction, which concerns Reprobation; and it is this, Consider the parties rejected absolutely in themselves, as Objects presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before the Lord to be disposed of in a way of Justice, and then our position is this, God doth not condemn, neither did
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:205094:106"/>he decree, or ordain any unto condemnation, but Sinners, and for Sin: God doth shew mercy, because he will, but he will not have men to perish, because it is his will, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of their sins.<note place="margin">Rom. 2.9.</note>

                        </gap>th evill.</hi> That's the Rule.</p>
                  <p>Reprobation is a preterition or passing by,<note place="margin">What Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is.</note> or a purpose not to have mercy upon some of the lost Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> but to leave them to perish in their sins: Our Reformed Divines do warily distinguish of a two-fold Act in Reprobation; the first negative (namely) <hi>Propositum non miserendiseu pretere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undi,</hi> a purpose not to have mercy on them:<note place="margin">Syn. <hi>Dort</hi> Art. 1. pag 42.</note> the other posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive (namely) <hi>Propositum damnandi, &amp; ordinatio ad exitium, ut justam poenam,</hi> a purpose to execute wrath on Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors, because of their sins, his Justice so requiring: But these two Acts are not to be severed, forasmuch as those on whom he will not have mercy, he intends to punish for their sinnes: for to my apprehension there is no other decree of Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but this purpose of God,<note place="margin">The nature of Reprobation.</note> to execute that judiciary Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death on all mankind, for breach of the first cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Obedience made with <hi>Adam,</hi> which Covenant, the wicked do proceed to break more and more by their daily sins, and so work out their own Damnation, by their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, Disobedience, and wilfull contempt of Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>That first Covenant stands still in force against all the world, All are under it; and Gods justice must be satisfied for all the disobedience of the Sons of <hi>Adam;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 8.24. John 16.9.</note> yet with this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and blessed difference; God punisheth the sins of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in the person of Christ, but the sinnes of others in their own persons; on the one sort he shewes the severity of his Law and Justice; on the other, the rich mercy of the Gospel. This is the <hi>Grace</hi> of the Gospel so much magnified by the Apostle, not that the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>made voyd</hi> by it: But whereas God might have required full payment and satisfaction in our own persons, he doth accept it in the person of Christ, and so we have a protection against the damnatory sentence of sin and the law; which seeing the unregenerate world, being out of Christ, have not, they must answer for themselves.</p>
                  <p>The state of Nature in which we remain untill we be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,<note place="margin">State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miserable.</note>
                     <pb n="190" facs="tcp:205094:107"/>and planted effectually into Christ, is first a state of Condemnation: <hi>John</hi> 3.3. Secondly, it is a state of Death in Sin. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Dead in Sins and Trespasses.</hi> Thirdly, a state of Enmity, they are enemies to God, and God to them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7.<note place="margin">Col. 1.21.</note>
                     <hi>The carnall minde is enmity against God, it is not subject to the Law of God:</hi> Fourthly, a state of Insufficiency to help our selves: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6. <hi>We were without strength:</hi> And is it a light thing to be found in such a state as this? Is it a light thing to be dead in Sins and Trespasses? to be an Enemy to God? to be a Child of wrath? May not God justly cast off, and punish such a generation and race of Men? And what shall we do, if God did not deliver us from this state of Death? In this state God finds us all, out of this state he chooseth some. In this state he leaveth others to go on in sin, and perish for ever: And this is it which I said before (namely) that God doth not condemn, nor decree to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn any, but Sinners, and for Sin, originall and actuall: And so did our Divines conclude in the Synod of <hi>Dordt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Syn. Dort.</hi> 1. Art. pag. 15. Thesis 5.</note>
                     <hi>Deus ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minem damnat, aut damnationi destinat, nisi ex consideratione peccati.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is farther proved by these Reasons following: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> No man is ordained unto punishment justly, but for some fault: But Damnation is an act of punishing-justice, therefore it doth presuppose a fault going before it: And hereof God will sufficiently convince the Reprobates; God will not deal with them by way of Soveraignty, or Power, but of Justice; they shall not say, that they are over-powered, and so cast in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Hell, but at the day of the Declaration of Gods righteous Judgements, their mouths shall be stopped, and all ungodly ones be convinced of all their evill deeds which they have committed.</p>
                  <p>The Reprobates are called <hi>vessels of wrath,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label> Rom. 9.22. Now the wrath of God is against sinne,<note place="margin">They are sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners before they are objects of Wrath.</note> and onely against sinne, according as it is said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.18. <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodlinesse and unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> Such as God doth punish in time, such onely did he decree before time to be punished; for there is not one rule
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:205094:107"/>of punishing, and another of decreeing punishments; Gods Execution shews his Intention, and therefore seeing he doth actually punish none but for sin, therefore I conclude that he doth not reprobate or ordain unto punishment any but Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and that for Sin.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, as in our Protestant Writers, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse. </seg>
                     </label> I judge it better to forbear those unscripturall termes of <hi>absolute, peremptory, irrespective</hi> Decree of Reprobation, because they minister matter of strife, by occasion of which, our Doctrine is misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and rendred odious with horrid consequences; so I humbly crave leave to declare on behalf of the Protestant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (accounting for the Protestants Doctrine, not what this or that Doctor doth hold, or teach, but what is set forth by the Protestant Churches in their publique Confessions of Faith, and in their Synodicall Acts) that we hold not, that God created men to shew his power in their destruction; neither do we hold, that God ever decreed to punish his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Creatures, as it is a Creature, or that God would have men to perish, because it is his will, without respect of the Creatures sin deserving punishment. This branch of our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction thus opened, cuts off all blasphemous conceits about Gods decree of Reprobation.</p>
                  <p>Now follows the second branch of our distinction,<note n="2" place="margin">Branch of our distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> which saith thus, If ye consider the persons elected, or rejected, compared one with the other, that then they are both alike before the Lord; and God doth not choose one, nor refuse the other for any Goodnesse or Wickednesse, for any Faith or Unbelief, that he sees in one more than in the other,<note place="margin">Comparative election and reprobation.</note> but meerly because it is his good pleasure so to do. If ye ask why <hi>Peter</hi> is chosen rather than <hi>Judas,</hi> or why <hi>Judas</hi> is reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted rather than <hi>Peter,</hi> there is no cause, motive, or conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the parties themselves, to be rendred of this discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but onely Gods good pleasure, which he purposed in himself, which the Apostle calls <hi>The mysterie of his Will,</hi> Eph. 1.9. and <hi>the counsell of his own will,</hi> ver. 11. And herein God shews the freeness of his Grace, and the soveraignty of his Power, <hi>I will have mercy upon whom I will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth,</hi> Rom. 9.15, 18.</p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:205094:108"/>
                  <p>This is that truth which I promised to prove (namely) that it is suitable to God to shew mercy to some in misery, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> and to passe by others in the same condition, and that without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration or fore-sight of Faith, or any other quality in them whom he chooseth, more than in them whom he reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth: In this Comparative sense the nature of Gods Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is best discerned; if God did love all to life, there would be Love indeed, but no Election; for he that taketh all, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth no choice of any; if he did choose upon fore-sight of Faith, as a condition in the Object to be chosen, then Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should not stand in the will and purpose of him that cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, but of him that is called; it would be <hi>of him that willeth, and of him that runneth,</hi> and <hi>not of God that sheweth mercy,</hi> Rom. 9.11, 16.</p>
                  <p>To make way to the proofs, I shall give you a short view of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine touching this matter, the rather that our adversaries may see from whose sparks it is that they have kindled their new lights.</p>

                  <p>For by his Decree God doth ordain certain persons to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Besides, this generall Election is no Election at all, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>2</label> for by it, <hi>Peter</hi> (for examples sake) is no more chosen than <hi>Judas;</hi> if <hi>Peter</hi> happen to live and die a Believer, then he is chosen, and upon the same termes <hi>Judas</hi> is one of Gods elect, yea, <hi>Peter</hi> may be the Reprobate, and <hi>Judas</hi> the Elect, for any thing that God hath done for one more than the other; yea, <hi>Clement,</hi> and all those blessed soules,<note place="margin">Philip. 4.3.

                  <p>The Scripture speaketh expresly of an individuall, nominal, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>3</label> particular Election of them that be heires of Glory, God hath chosen us and you, your names are written in Heaven: <hi>The Lord knoweth them that are his,</hi>

Now upon the Separation, the Kingdom is given to them for whom it was prepared; it was not prepared for some, and given to others: it is at last given to certain particular persons, therefore for them it was prepared in Gods Predestina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>They erre in saying that there were many other things which God might have chosen to be the conditions of our Election and Salvation, but God, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Error. </seg>2</label> according to the good pleasure of his will, did freely make choice of Faith in Christ,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:205094:110"/>to be that condition: First, Let it be considered, how basely these men doe obscure the glory of Gods <hi>Grace,</hi> wherein he hath <hi>made us accepted in the Beloved;</hi> For by this account, those high and glorious expressions of our being <hi>predestinated according to the good pleasure of his will,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 1.6, 7, 8, 9.</note>
                     <hi>to the praise of the glory of his Grace, according to the riches of his Grace, the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of his Will,</hi> shall amount to no more but this, that God, instead of our persons, hath chosen a quality, and that without any great thanks or cause of admiration, for he might have made choice of other qualities as well as that; O what a flat, jejune, empty conceit is this of so high a mercy!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, but tell me in good earnest, Is there any other way? Yea, many other waies possible to make us the <hi>chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gal. 3.26.</note> besides <hi>faith</hi> in Christ Jesus: Christ prayed, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if it be possible, let this cup passe from me:</hi> Christs prayer was heard, and if it had been possible by any other way, to save a sinner, Christ had not died. <hi>There is no other name un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heaven given,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 4.12. Heb. 3.14.</note>
                     <hi>by which men must be saved, neither is there salvation in any other, but in Christ,</hi> nor any other means to be partakers of Christ, but by <hi>Faith.</hi> Thus is Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse obscured, and made void; for if there be many other conditions that would serve the turne, Christ died in vain.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, How shamefully is the wisdome of God obscured by this Doctrine! It was beyond the wit of Man or Angel to devise a way, how a Sinner might be justified, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main just.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.20, 21.</note>
                     <hi>Where is the Wise? where is the Scribe? where is the Disputer of this world? When the world by all their wisdome knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishnesse of preaching, to save them that believe:</hi> None of the Princes of the world knew it;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.12.

                     <hi>the hidden wisdom of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he hath abounded unto us in all wisdome and prudence:</hi> Now why did God (as I may speak with reverence) set his wisdom on work to find out this way for his mercy, if this be
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:205094:110"/>but one way of many as possible as this? It is pity an Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian wit had not been called to counsell, he could have told of twenty other waies as fit to be the conditions of Election and Salvation, as Faith in Christ Jesus: But we must not wonder at this, if we call to mind, that when they speak of Faith in Christ, they take it for the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>credere,</hi> for the very Act of believing, as it is a quality, not an instrument, laying hold on Christ, and then indeed many other conditions might have been thought on and accepted, according to the good pleasure of his will. Thus God might have appointed Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, or Valour, or Charity, or Temperance, or Patience, to be the conditions of Salvation, and decreed that those persons, in whom he should find the quality resolved on, should be elected and glorified: But abandoning this carnall, Jewish, legall, dunghill conceit of setting up in our imaginations any other possible condition of mercy; let us labour to be <hi>found in Christ,</hi> not having any other righteousnesse, but the <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of Christ, which is by Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly,<note place="margin">Their third Error.</note> They erre in saying that <hi>(fidelis perseveraturus)</hi> a Believer in the point of death, is the Object of Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat, full, and irrevocable election unto life; they hold, that Believers in this life are elected, yet with an election that is incompleat, revocable and alterable, God is feigned to su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spend his full determination of any man, till he be dying, and have actually performed the condition required <hi>in objecto eligibili,</hi> in the party to be chosen (namely) perseverance in the Faith: The ground of this Error is another Error (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that true Believers may fall away, and so he that is an elect Vessel to day, may be a Reprobate to morrow, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he die: <hi>Fatemur enim non illubentes, eos qui ad tempus verâ fide credunt, pro isto tempore in gratiâ esse, &amp; proinde non minore jure electos dici posse, quàm justificatos; quia videlicet in statu illo sunt, in quo si perseverarent,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I shall not here overthrow the ground of this Error, it shall suffice to discover the falshood of the oipnion by two Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="tcp:205094:111"/>
                  <p>First, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>1</label> The Apostles order in that golden Chain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. is quite contrary to it, and is perverted by this opinion, for the links must be new placed, thus, whom he did <hi>fore-know,</hi> them he <hi>called,</hi> and whom he <hi>called,</hi> them he <hi>justified,</hi> and whom he <hi>justified</hi> (being now actuall Believers) them he <hi>predestinated</hi> (Predestination must come in there) and then immediately, whom he thus <hi>predestinated,</hi> them he <hi>glorified:</hi> The Text saies, that we are <hi>predestinated</hi> before we be <hi>called</hi> or <hi>justified;</hi> they say, nay, but we are first <hi>called</hi> and <hi>justified</hi> being actually in Christ by Faith, and then <hi>predestinated;</hi> The Text saies, we are <hi>elected before the world was made;</hi> they say, we are not elected till the world be ended, as to us: How can this opinion consist with those plaine words of the Apostle, 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>He called us with an holy calling, according to his own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, before the world began;</hi> Note first, that the <hi>purpose</hi> and <hi>grace</hi> of God there goes before our <hi>holy calling,</hi> for our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is according to that purpose.

                  <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>2</label> This opinion doth confound <hi>Predestination</hi> with <hi>Glorification,</hi> as if they were not two, but one and the same thing; for thus they teach, that Gods full and determinate election of certain persons to glory, is to be considered <hi>sub ratione praemii,</hi>

And wherein doth this Election differ from Glorification it self? The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding and crowning of the faithfull with eternall life, is it
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:205094:111"/>not their Glorification? At the end of our daies, when we receive the end of our hopes, the salvation of our fouls, we are not then to be looked upon as persons to be chosen, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready chosen, and now to be brought into possession which was so long ago prepared for them. I conclude with that of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. <hi>I have finished my Course, I have k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>pt the Faith, henceforth,</hi> What henceforth doth he expect, that God should elect him to a Crown of life? No, but he expects that God should now bestow it; <hi>Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown;</hi> that is, upon the finishing of his Course, and keeping of the Faith, the very next thing is the giving of the Crown.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>3</label> By this opinion Election and Predestination be quite thrust out of doore; there is no Election till we have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished our course say they, and when we have finished it, then immediately comes our Glorification, at which time, as there will be no need of Election; so there will be no place for it. Thus is the great mysterie of Gods Grace, that first Grace, from whence are derived all other Graces, and helps effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for the obtaining our blessed end, made void, and to have no place in the course of mans Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I come now to their fourth Error, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Error. </seg>4</label> which groundeth the act of Gods Predestination upon his fore-sight of mans Faith, or of some goodnesse in them whom he chooseth, more than in others whom he rejecteth.</p>
                  <p>Contrary unto which Error, I have laid my third Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it is the summe of the second Branch of my distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, (namely) if you consider the person Elected and Reprobated as compared one with the other, then they are both alike before the Lord: God doth not choose one for any Faith or goodnesse foreseene in him, more than in the other, whom he rejecteth, but meerely because it is his good pleasure so to do.</p>
                  <p>First, True it is, that they which believe and obey the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, are the elect of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is also true, that God foresees all things that are to come, good and evill: But false it is, that our Election dependeth upon such conditions foreseen; The
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:205094:112"/>truth of my Assertion is evidenced by these following Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>If Election doth go before our Faith and Obedience, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Argument. </seg>1</label> then Faith and Obedience are not the causes, or foregoing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, upon which our Election doth depend: But Election doth go before Faith and Obedience (we were elected before we had Faith, or considered, as having faith) Therefore Gods Election doth not depend on them. The first part of this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is cleare in common sense, for that which is done al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, doth not depend upon a condition or quality that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes after.</p>
                  <p>The Minor Proposition (namely) that Election goeth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Faith, is proved by these two places of Scripture. First, that place <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did predestinate, them he also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> &amp;c. It is evident, that Glorifying cometh after Justifying, Justifying after Calling, Calling after Predestinating or choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing unto life; therefore these Graces are after Predestination, not causes of it, Faith and Obedience to the Gospel comes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Calling (no man has Faith till he be called by the Gospel) and Calling comes after Predestination; therefore Faith it self must needs come after Predestination.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith and Holinesse are the fruits and effects of Election, therefore not the causes, or precedaneous conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof; the Effect is ever after the Cause, the Fountain is before the Stream: Now Gods Love in our Election is the Fountain from whence the blessed Streames of Faith, Adopti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.4, 5.</note> and Sanctification do flow, for so it is written, <hi>God hath chosen us in Christ, that we should be holy,</hi> not because we were holy, <hi>unto the Adoption of Children through Faith in Jesus Christ,</hi> not because we were so: Our Holinesse and our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption are things that we are chosen unto, and do follow Election; But are not things going before, and which we are chosen for:<note place="margin">Titus 1.1. Phil. 1.29.</note> Hence Faith is called <hi>the Faith of Gods Elect,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause to them <hi>it is given to believe, and to know the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Kingdome of God,</hi> according to that saying, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to eternall life, believed:</hi> which plainly teacheth, that Gods ordaining to life went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their believing; it is not said, <hi>as many as believed</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand)

                     <hi>were ordained to life;</hi> but <hi>as many as were ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to life, believed;</hi> Gods mercy ordained the means, as he did the end, and the means proved effectuall to them, not to all that heard it.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, <hi>That Election doth indeed goe before Faith,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer is easie (namely) unto God, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> things foreseen are as if they were present; God beholdeth all things to come, as present, and therefore if Election do not depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on actuall Faith, neither doth it upon the foresight of it, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditiones praestitae,</hi> and <hi>praescitae</hi> performed and foreseen, are all one in this dispute; and if one be excluded, so are the other also.</p>
                  <p>And surely, if Gods foresight had altered the case between the two Brothers, <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> he could have said,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.11.</note> that though for the present they were both alike, having <hi>done neither good nor evill,</hi> yet in Gods <hi>foresight</hi> they were not equall, and therefore <hi>God loved the one, and hated the other,</hi> but not allowing of any such quirk, he placeth the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them onely in the <hi>purpose</hi> of him that <hi>calleth.</hi> These works of Faith, Holinesse, Obedience, and the like, as in time they flowed from the grace of God; so they were foreseene likewise no otherwise, than as effects of his Grace in us, and consequently not as Causes or inducements to God to Elect us to eternall life, as will farther appeare by the other Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that follow.</p>
                  <p>Our second Argument is this, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Arg. </seg>2</label> God foresees no good in the Creature, which himselfe does not intend to worke.

Gal. 3.22.</note> seeing he hath <hi>shut up all in unbelief? The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath concluded, or shut up all under Sin. There is not one that doth good, no not one. Faith is not of our selves, it is the gift of God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ephes. 2.8.</note> So then he findeth not Faith in his Elect, but giveth them Faith. Secondly, and if he give it them, that he might elect us, the case is still the same, and the difficulty the same; for the Question will still be, Why doth God give faith to some, and not to others? Why doth not God make all men willing to believe and obey? And the Answer must be the same, which we give to them that ask, Why doth God choose some and not others in the same condition? It must at last be all resolved into his owne will, <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will.</hi> His grace is his owne, he may give it where he will, and if he have given Grace to any of us, let us praise him for his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and when we see others left without Grace, let us reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence him for his unsearchable judgements.</p>
                  <p>This Argument may be presented in a more easie forme thus: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> I demand concerning Gods Elect, Did God find them good, and so choose them, or make them good, that he might choose them? or did he choose them when they were sinners to make them good and holy?</p>
                  <p>First, God did not find them good and so choose them, for then there is some good in the Creatures, which God hath not wrought, yea, that great good of turning our selves to God by Faith, whereas others having the same helps, turned not; This cannot be admitted of by Gods word for two Reasons:</p>
                  <p>First, Because then <hi>Man</hi> should have whereof to <hi>glory,</hi> as having made himself <hi>to differ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Because it would follow, that we first chose him, not he us, contrary unto that <hi>John</hi> 15.16. <hi>You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you;</hi> for by the Doctrine of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon foresight of our Faith embracing Christ, it will follow, that we first chose Christ by Faith, and not he
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:205094:113"/>us, we embrace him first, and then God electeth us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Did God make us holy, that we might be eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, or fit Objects of our Election? No; but he chose us when we were lost Sinners, he pitied us in our Blood, he chose us that we should be holy, he found us not holy;<note place="margin">Rom. 4.5.</note>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> saith that <hi>God justifieth the ungodly;</hi> and if we were ungodly, when we were justified, then it is certain, we were so when we were chosen; for <hi>Justification</hi> is after <hi>Predestination,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.30.</note> therefore he chose the ungodly, and unholy, and strangers, that they might be made godly, and holy, and children through Grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If God did give us Faith first, and then upon sight thereof, did choose us, yet this would no whit advantage the cause, or remove the inconveniencies and absurdities; for the removall of which, this Election, upon foreseen Faith, was first invented; for still it is Gods grace that maketh thee to differ, if he foresee in us nothing but what he himself worketh of his meer grace, then his Act of Election doth not depend upon any foreseen quality in us, as a condition thereof, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God to elect; for all doth proceed from himself, and then the difficulty is still the same; for tell me, Why did God give grace to one, and not to the other? Why Faith to one, and not to others? That which answers this question will answer the other also; Why did God decree to save one, and not the other? And the answer to both, can be no other than because it so pleased him.</p>
                  <p>Our third Argument against foreseen Faith, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>but I will have mercy on whom I finde cause to have mercy: So then it is of him that willeth, and of him that runneth, and not of God, that shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth mercy: Thou needest not say then unto me, Why doth he yet finde fault?</hi> ver. 19. forasmuch as there is a plain reason of his will to be assigned (namely) God hath regard to Faith in one, and Infidelity in the other, <hi>and therefore O Man, who art thou, that repliest against God?</hi> Thou hast no cause to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postulate with God, seeing he can give this account to the Creature of his actions, that his Decree doth proceed not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on termes of Will, or Soveraignty, but of Justice and Equity, rendring to every man according to his deeds: It is free for God to choose Faith to be the condition going before Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it is just with God to cast away them that will not submit to this condition; for ver. 21. <hi>The Potter hath power of the Clay, to make one vessell to honour, another to dishonour,</hi> yet he is not to be blamed, if when he sees a good piece of Clay fit matter for a curious vessel, he does preferre that before a courser Clay, that will not endure to be wrought to a good vessel: According to that opinion this is the sense and drift of that Scripture, which because it doth directly contradict and overthrow the scope of the Apostle, it is to be abhorred, as measuring the mysteries of God by, and arraigning his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable waies at the bar of carnall Reason.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this point, I note more particularly, four things in that ninth chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which can no waies consist with this opinion of previsionall Election.</p>
                  <p>First, The Apostle discoursing of the casting off of some of the Jewes, and not others; he doth industriously, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately presuppose and presse an equality and parity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all consideration of inequality, by reason of good or evill in the persons, as the moving cause or condition, why one should be chosen, and not the other, as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau,</hi> Children of one Father, and one Mother, not yet born, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done neither good or evill, &amp;c. And so in the comparison of the Potter, he doth shew Gods freedome to choose or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, when the Persons be every way as the same Clay, in the same Case, in the same Condition.</p>
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:205094:114"/>
                  <p>Secondly, By what Analogie of reason can <hi>Esau,</hi> which had as <hi>yet done no evill,</hi> be a type or figure of men rejected for doing evil, for persevering in unbelief; and how can <hi>Jacob,</hi> which as <hi>yet</hi> had <hi>done no good,</hi> be a type and figure of men elected, for the good they have done for their perseverance in Faith?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that instance of the <hi>Potter,</hi> if the <hi>Potter</hi> should thus reason and resolve with himselfe, if the whole lump be capable of an excellent form, then I will make it up all into Vessels of Honour, but else into Vessels for baser uses; if he should thus reason, then where were his <hi>power over the Clay?</hi> Would it not then follow, that it was in the <hi>Clay,</hi> and not in the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Potter,</hi> that this is a Vessel for best uses, and that for baser?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It would cease to be a mysterie, there would be no cause to wonder and admire at S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection and Reprobation, neither were there any cause why S. <hi>Paul</hi> should move such an objection, <hi>Why doth God finde fault? for who hath resisted his will?</hi> v. 19. And at last answers the Objection, and stops mans mouth with the absolutenesse and freedome of Gods will, if there were any other cause or condition in the Persons themselves, of their Election and Reprobation.</p>
                  <p>The Answer had been easie: This hath God done, because he saw good in one, and obstinate impenitency in the other; although the will of God be alwaies grounded upon reason for whatsoever he doth, yet he is not to give an account to us of his actions, why he disposeth thus and thus of men; and therefore the Apostle here stoppeth the mouth of all that move such curious questions, with <hi>Nay, but O Man, who art thou that repliest against God?</hi> The Apostle saith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. that <hi>God worketh all things after the counsel of his own wil:</hi> note from thence, that the things, which he decreeth and purposeth, are most perfectly wise and good; there is reason enough in God for whatsoever he doth, for he doth all things by <hi>Counsel;</hi> yet secondly, it is a <hi>Counsel</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> and therefore unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; we must not measure it by our reason; considering that the Will of God is <hi>unsearchable;</hi> No man hath been <hi>his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:205094:115"/>
                  <p>Thus I have at length dispatched my three Conclusions, (namely)</p>
                  <p>First, That there is such a Decree in Gods fore-ordaining mens future estate, and what that Decree is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That none but the Elect are saved.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That God doth shew mercy on some in misery, and passe by others in the same condition, and that without the foresight of any condition in the party chosen: And what hath the Adversary to reply against this Truth?</p>
                  <p>He saith, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>1</label>
                     <hi>It is not suitable to God, to pick and choose among men, in shewing mercy, because he may as well cease to be, as to withhold mercy from any one in misery; if he did, the defect must be in his heart, or in his ability; now know it is not for want of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lond. Test. p. 8.</note>
                     <hi>if God shew not mercy to all, and to ascribe it to his heart, or his will, is to blaspheme his excellent Name and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer is easie: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> First, God is a most free Agent, and therefore doth shew mercy, not by any necessity of Nature, but according to the freenesse of his will, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will,</hi> and who shall challenge him for it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. <hi>Gulpanda est in judicialibus, non in gratuitis.</hi>
                     </note> If God were to distribute Justice, then all men in the same case, should speed alike; but Election is an act not of Justice, but of Grace and favour; his Grace is his own, he may give it where he will, and none have cause to complain: Let it suffice, God oweth us nothing, except Death for our Sins; acts of Justice are deserved, but acts of Grace are free, not due, nor deserved by any one.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God will be glorified in his Justice as well as in his mercy. Rom. 9.17, 22, 23. <hi>For this cause I raised thee up, that my name might be declared throughout all the earth,</hi> therefore it is no blaspheming of his excellent name, to say, that God will not have mercy on all.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine of Election is suitable, first, to Gods Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, forasmuch as in contriving the salvation of a Sinner, is made known the manifold wisdom of God.</p>

                  <p>The strongest Arguments that I have met withall in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish, against Gods Decree, of Reprobation especially, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The members and parts of the Distinction above mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, being fitly and warily applied, do discover the falshood, and inconsequence of most of his Arguments.

                  </p>
                  <p>First, That God doth exercise any such absolute dominion or soveraignty over the reasonable Creatures, as to create such infinite multitudes of men, that he might torment them for ever, after a short life here ended, without any fault at all of theirs pre-existing in his eternal minde, for we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:205094:116"/>that God does neither condemn, nor decree to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, any but Sinners, and for Sin.</p>
                  <p>Nor Secondly, do we hold, that God decreed <hi>Adam</hi> to fall, otherwise than by permitting it; he never decreed either to do Sin, or command it to be done, neither did any Decree of God force <hi>Adam</hi> to sin: <hi>Adam</hi> sinned most freely, he brake a most easie Commandement <hi>(Thou shalt not eat of the tree of Knowledge)</hi> he had but one Commandement, he brake that; he believed the voice of the Tempter, which said, <hi>Thou shalt not die,</hi> more than the voice of God, which told him, <hi>He should die in the day that he did eat thereof.</hi>

                  <p>thirdly, Nor doth it follow of our Doctrine, that God in permitting <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, was the author of his sin, or of any the sins that followed thereupon. It is true, that God doth suffer sin to be, else there could be none; if God would ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely hinder it;<note place="margin">Acts 14.16.</note> And it is as true, that a permissive decree is no cause of sin, because it is meerly extrinsecall to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and hath no influence at all upon the sinne: If a feeble house be upheld by props, he that shall take away those props, is the cause of the fall of that house: But the case is not so between God and <hi>Adam; Adam</hi> was made not feeble, but upright, and able to stand; God did not instill into his mind any evil; nay, God did not withdraw or take from him any Grace or strength formerly given him, onely he did not hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him from falling, who was able to stand if he would; no power or fraud of Sathan, could have vanquished him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse he himself would voluntarily yeild, which he did, and therefore had no excuse for his sin, when God called to an account:<note place="margin">Gods love to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

By one mans disobedience, many were made sinners; By one mans offence, Death reigned by one;</hi> We ow our sin and misery unto our first Parents breach of Covenant. To shew it in a comparison, Suppose some Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Master of a Family, should cast out of his house the Mother, that hath played the Harlot, and all her Bastard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brood,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:205094:116"/>were not this just? And if the Children should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of hard usage, and plead their innocency, saying, What evil have we done? Might not the Master of the house say to them, Go plead with your Mother, she is not my Wife, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are you my Children, therefore away with the Mother and Brats together? Thus did God say to a generation of Idolaters, who were upon the point of being divor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from God, and cast off from being his people, <hi>Lo-am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi, ye are not my People, and I will not be your God,</hi> Hos. 1.9. They are brought in complaining of Gods dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with them; the Lord stops their mouths, and sayes to them, <hi>Plead with your Mother,</hi> as if he should say, do not contend or quarrel with me, but plead with your Mother, Hos. 2.2. <hi>For she is not my Wife, she hath broken Covenant with me by her Idolatries, neither am I her Husband, and therefore I will not have mercy upon her Children, for they be Children of whoredome,</hi> ver 4. In like manner may God say to all that charge God for their being rejected in their naturall estate; go plead with <hi>Adam,</hi> for he brake Covenant with me, he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully disobeyed my voice, and so brought on himself and his posterity, the sentence of Death threatned, in case he should transgresse: Of this I shall speak again in the next chapter of Originall Sin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, We do not hold, nor doth it follow of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that Gods Decree does determine mans will to sin, or lay any necessity of sinning upon it; <hi>Adam,</hi> and all men af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him, sin voluntarily of their own will,<note place="margin">Gods love to mankind, pag. 35.

Though Gods Providence ordereth and governeth the evill wills and actions of men, yet he determines them not to evil;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>White</hi>'s way, p. 267.</note> they act from principles of their own reason and judgement, whereby they judge of things good or evill, which accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:205094:117"/>they freely choose, or refuse, doe, or leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
                  <p>It doth not follow then, that all things come to passe of necessity, because of Gods Decree or Fore-knowledge; our memory is not the cause of things past, neither is our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of things to come; God doth foresee all things that are to come, both things certain, and things contingent, and his fore-knowledge is not deceived, yet his will and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight laies no necessity upon mans will; Wicked men act wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly and freely, because Wickednesse is in their wils; Godly men act graciously and freely, because Grace is in their wils: Grace is in their wils moving and inclining them to the thing that is good; their wils are set at liberty by Grace, which sanctifieth their reason and judgement, their consultations and the bent of their wils: God doth not infuse any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint into the mind of man to enforce it, nor any Error to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it, nor impose any Necessity to bind it: All things work according to the Law of their Creation, natural Agents na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, contingent Things contingently, voluntary Agents voluntarily; the Godly are not good against their wils, for of unwilling God makes us willing to the thing that is good: and as for the Wicked, he needs not force or make them willing to Evil, or unwilling to Good, for they are so by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, It doth not follow of our Doctrine, that all endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours after Life and Salvation are in vain,<note place="margin">a Pet. 1.10.</note> for by <hi>giving dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> we may <hi>make our Calling and Election sure:</hi> And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly he doth not labour in vain, that attains to that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and sweet Assurance; if ye seek, knock, hearken and obey, ye are the Elect of God, as is declared above.</p>

                  <p>I answer: First, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> If God had pleasure in the death of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he would not have been at such costs for the saving of so many millions of souls, as he hath been by the Incarnation, Death, Sufferings, Resurrection, Ascension of his deare Son, and by establishing such a course of Ordinanances for the conversion and salvation of Sinners.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is resolved to execute the sentence of death upon many of the lost Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> for breach of that first Covenant; and so he told <hi>Adam</hi> beforehand, that he would do; here is no dissembling in all this.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Both these Propositions are true; <hi>God willeth the death of a Sinner,</hi> and <hi>God willeth not the death of a Sinner:</hi> Sinners that enjoy the means of Grace, of be two sorts; some there be whose hearts do melt and relent when they heare Gods voice; they hearken and obey, and turn from the evil of their doings; and God willeth not the death of such: Others there be that stop the ear, refuse to return, they will not come up to the terms of the Gospel; and God willeth the punishment of such, that is, their death; <hi>The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all unrighteousnesse of men:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 1.18.</note> This is plain dealing, here is no dissembling in all this: And this is the very case of them, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21, 23, 32. <hi>If the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked turn from his sins that he hath committed, he shall surely live and not die; Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die, saith the Lord, and not that he should return from his waies and live?</hi> Here God commends his Love to poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that repent, and his unpartial Justice against all that commit iniquity, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. God willeth not the sin of a Sinner, nor his obstinacy in sin; yet he willeth the punishment of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate Sinners, which is death; if God did not in some sort will the death of a Sinner, how could he judge the World?

                     <note place="margin">Pag 68.</note>
                     <hi>whom he will not furnish with necessary power to believe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer two things: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, That though Christ, together with the gift of Faith and Grace, effectual to Conversion, be given only to the Elect; yet Salvation by the Gospel is generally and promiscuously offered unto all Sinners for two Reasons: First, because we do not know who be Elect, nor who be Reprobates; the Gospel finds them all sinners alike, and all alike capable of Salvation; the time of Separation is not yet come, neither are we able to make such a Separation, neither is it our office, the Angels shall do that at the end of the world; He that is not converted to day, may be converted to morrow; our Commission is, <hi>Preach the Gospel to every creature.</hi> The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Reason; the offer is general, to the intent that none of the Elect might be lost, and that all mouths might be stopped; seeing none are excluded that do not exclude themselves, they might all finde mercy, if they would but submit to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> I answer out of <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. where you have First, our Doctrine, ver. 18. <hi>He hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth:</hi> Secondly, there is your Objection, ver. 19. <hi>Thou wilt say then, why doth he yet finde fault?</hi> for <hi>who hath resisted his will?</hi> Thirdly, you have S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Answer to your Objection, ver. 20. <hi>Nay but O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Hath not the Potter power over the Clay?</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In the Doctrine note two things: First, That those which be under mercy, he mollifieth, the rest he hardneth; that one is softned, it is of mercy, the other are hardned by withhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Grace and Mercy; even as darknesse and frost are caused by the absence of the Sun, the Sun is not the cause of darknesse, nor of the Waters congealing into Ice, but yet both follow upon the absence of the Sun naturally.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If the Question be asked why God doth mollifie
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:205094:118"/>some, and harden others? the Text saies, it is because he will <hi>(whom he will he hardneth)</hi> upon this doth arise your Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if God will not have mercy on us, but will leave us to be hardned, why then doth he find fault with us for our hardness of heart, seeing his will must stand? This is the force of your Objection: Now mark the Apostles Answer, ver. 20. <hi>O man, who art thou that repliest against God?</hi> The meaning of his Answer is this (namely) God may justly find fault with thy hardnesse of heart, though he for his part will not mollifie it; and with thy unbelief, though he intend not to give thee effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual means of Faith. He may justly find fault with thy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly courses, though he give thee no account; besides his own will why he will not soften thy heart: as if he should say, Who art thou that repliest against God? It is enough to tell thee that God will give Grace and Mercy to others, and not to thee. His Grace is his owne, his Gifts be his owne, he may give them to whom he will, and who shall challenge him for it? He ows thee nothing, but Death for thy Sins; he is not bound to restore thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is true, that God simply and absolutely is bound to no man,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>3</label>
                     <hi>because he is a most free dispenser of his owne favours, where, and to whom he will; but yet he is conditionally bound two waies:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First</hi> Promittendo, <hi>Promise is a Debt; if therefore God hath made a Promise of any Gift, or Grace to any man, his Promise bindeth him to performance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Legem ferendo, <hi>by giving men a Law to keep, which without supernaturall Grace, they can no more keep than eat a rock: God indeed is not bound to restore those abilities,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gods love to mankind pag. 73.</note>
                     <hi>which we once received and lost in</hi> Adam; <hi>but now seeing God hath vouchsafed to enter into a new Covenant of peace with men, when he needed not, and in that Covenant requireth Obedience at mens hands, even at theirs that perish, with promise of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life to every man, if he obey and keep the Covenant, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing with everlasting death the disobedient: These particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars supposed, the most free God is now engaged to give ability of believing unto men; nor can he justly, without this gift, punish the disobedient; the giving of the new Covenant doth presuppose
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:205094:119"/>either an ability in the Sinner to believe and repent, or a purpose in God to give them that ability, else he could not justly punish the disobedient and unbeliever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer three things: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, That to believe in God, and every word of his, either promising Life or threatning Death, was a duty and an ability given to <hi>Adam;</hi> (<hi>Adams</hi> Sin was Unbelief) and therefore he may justly require to be believed and obeyed of all <hi>Adams</hi> Posterity: Habitual Faith doth respect all possible Objects that shall be revealed, as well as those that are actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed; And God does not give a new specifical Faith, when he presents a new Object to be believed; <hi>Abraham</hi> believed the Creation of the World; by the same Faith he believed that he should have a Son: and therefore though it were not suitable to the state of Innocency for <hi>Adam</hi> to believe in a Mediator actually, yet by the Faith which he had, he could, and ought to believe every Promise that should proceed out of the mouth of God: As we need not new Eyes to see new Objects; the same visive faculty which sees things present, can see things which shall be laid before it. <hi>Adam</hi> had no need to behold the Brazen Serpent, because he was not stung; but if <hi>Adam</hi> had been in the Wildernesse when that Serpent was lifted up, he could have seen it with his Paradise eyes, as his Posterity did: So is the present case in regard of Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Actual Faith in order to Christ to be revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
                  <p>But to come nearer home to the purpose, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> I grant, that the giving of a Law to the Creature does presuppose an ability in the Creature already received, or to be given to perform the conditions therein required (God doth not propose Life and Death to his Creatures upon a condition impossible) and such an ability doth God engage to bestow in the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;<note place="margin">Jerem 31.33.</note> so runs the Tenour of the New Covenant, Hebr. 10.11, 12. <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the house of</hi> Israel, <hi>after those daies, saith the Loed, I will put my laws in their minde, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people, and I will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull to their unrighteousnesse, and their sins and iniquities will
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:205094:119"/>I remember no more.</hi> Here are three things distinctly to be considered:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Matter, and chief Blessing of the Covenantion Gods part, <hi>I will be to them a God,</hi> &amp;c.<note place="margin">Gen. 17.7.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is expressed the Bond and Condition of it on our part, and that is Faith and Obedience, signified in those words, of <hi>putting Gods Lawes in our mindes,</hi> &amp;c. So God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Abraham;</hi> Gen. 17.1. <hi>Walk before me, and be thou perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is also a Promise and Declaration, that God will work this Condition, by which men shall have an interest in this Covenant, and a right to the blessing thereof, <hi>I will put my lawes in their mindes:</hi> The matter of our Duty is the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Gods Promise; that which God requireth of us, he undertakes to work in us: He requires that we should know the Lord, and he promiseth we shall be all taught of God; He requires that we walk in Obedience uprightly before him; and because we shall not faile of doing our duty on our parts; He promiseth to write his Laws in our hearts. First, the grand blessing of the Covenant is, I will be their God, and pardon their sins. Secondly, the qualifications of the Persons, to whom this promise is made, They are such, in whose hearts Gods Laws are written, that is, such as believe. Thirdly, the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of this their Faith, I will write, I will change their hearts, I will give them Faith. Thus you see that God doth perform what he is bound unto, <hi>legem ferendo,</hi> by giving a new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yea,</hi>

                     <hi>but then the Reprobate are punished for not fulfilling and observing the conditions of a Covenant, which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made with them; Why does God punish them for their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief?</hi>

                  <p>Hitherto you have seen, First, that God gave ability to all in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>

Though I cannot by my own strength rise from death in sin, yet an earnest care whereby I deliberate, is that means which the Spirit useth to prevent me, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Deliberat. </seg>1</label> and therefore if I will be saved or reclaimed from sin, <hi>I</hi> must admit deliberation and consultation about my spiritual Estate (as the Prodigall did) as the first motion that God casteth into my mind for the effecting thereof, and not stay till I feel some violent and sensible impulsions enforcing me, but accept even that small motion of care and consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the which to cast away, is to reject Gods offer inviting me to my uprising.</p>
                  <p>Next, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> though we have not power to convert our selves, yet all men have power to use the outward meanes and liberty to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:205094:120"/>hear the voice of Gods Word and Spirit inviting them to consider of their Estate, which is sufficient to make them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable, if they resist it.</p>
                  <p>God worketh some things in us without us, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which by his Spirit he casts into us, as we lie plunged in sin, whereby he awakes us, and bids us think of our uprising. God worketh some things in us, and with us, as a good will to receive those motions, and not to resist the Spirit: God worketh some things in us and by us, as all such good works, as the motion of the Spirit teacheth us to do. Thus far that learned Author hath taught us. These things the reprobate have ability to do (namely) to consult, to use outward means, to yield to good motions, which seeing they have no will to doe, God may justly punish their wilfull impeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</p>
                  <p>Thus through the assistance of Gods holy Spirit, I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished this weighty point; The conclusion of all is, <hi>Our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction is from our selves, but our salvation is from the Lord, who sheweth mercy: How unsearchable are his judgements, and his waies past finding out; for who hath known the minde of the Lord? or who hath been his Counsellour? or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompenced unto him againe,</hi> Rom. 11.33, 35.</p>

                  <p>AGainst which Error I oppose this Truth, that the state of reprobate men and Angels in Hell, is unchangeable, and never to be regained. I say of Men in Hell, or after this life; for of such I suppose the Author speaks, because he joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them with the reprobate Angels, who are kept under everlasting chains of darknesse, to the Judgement of the great Day; their state in misery is unalterable; the Devils shall never recover Heaven again, and Reprobate men shall never
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:205094:121"/>be made Elect; of miserable they shall never be made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, they shall never regain the happinesse of <hi>Adam</hi> in an earthly Paradise, nor of the glorified Saints in the Kingdome of saved ones. <hi>Arminians</hi> tell us of a Reprobation of men in this life, which is but conditionate, and incompleat, and therefore reversible, if they repent; but after this life their Damnation is sealed, in the Grave there is no Wisdome, and in Hell there is no Repentance, and from Hell there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; the Scripture is plain and full in this point. Mat. 25.41. <hi>Christ shall say to them on the left hand, Depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> The wicked shall then be parted from the godly for ever; ver. 46. <hi>These shall go away into everlasting punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but the righteous into life eternall.</hi> Hel was first prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Devils, but because men cleave to the Devil, and forsake God, therefore their portion is with the Devils in Hel for evermore. If their condition were alterable, then the fire were not everlasting; but the Scripture tels us, that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jude v 6, 7. Mark 9.44.</note>

                  <p>The reason hereof is, because after Death and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>
                     </label> there is no means of Recovery; if men desire to escape that Judgement, they must now, whilst they are in this life, hearken, and be obedient to the Gospel of Salvation; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life is gained or lost in this world, after Death comes Judgement, there is no place for Repentance, no preaching, nor warnings, nor means of Conversion, nay, nor yet any heart or will to repent.</p>
                  <p>This unalterable condition of the Damned is taught in that Parable, Luke 16.26. <hi>Besides all this, there is a great gulf fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed, so that they which would passe from hence to you, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, neither can they passe from us that would come from thence.</hi> There is a vast distance, so that none can passe from Heaven to Hell, nor from Hell to Heaven; as the Blessednesse of these, so the Misery of the other is unchangeable, and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting: The means to keep men from coming into this place
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:205094:121"/>of torment, is appointed for the living; ver. 29. <hi>They have</hi> Moses <hi>and the Prophets, let them heare them;</hi> if they neglect that salvation whilst it is offered them, if they will not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded by the Word of God, there is no other means left, they will certainly come into that place of torment, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish everlastingly.</p>
                  <p>O that men had hearts to believe, and be affected with this Truth: <label type="milestone">

                  <p>Try and consider, Canst thou endure thy finger in the flame now for an hour?

How woful then is their case, that must endure it for ever in Hel with the Devils? Pray, O pray, that God would give thee a believing heart, a melting heart, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting heart, to lay to heart the things that belong to thy everlasting peace, before they be hid from thine eyes. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not vain words of vain men, which serve to harden fools in their sin, whilst they perswade them that there is no Hel, or that the state of the damned is recoverable: If thou wilt not believe this truth now, thou shalt believe and feel it hereafter to thy cost: Is it not a strange thing said, that there should be
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:205094:122"/>Atheists on Earth, and none in Hel? poor souls, they know there is a just God, which taketh vengeance, though they would not believe it whilst they lived: if the damned in hel had leave to enjoy but one of the daies of the Son of Man of Grace, which you now enjoy, O what zealous Creatures would they be for their own salvation? How fervent in spirit serving the Lord? How restlesse, till they had gotten the pardon of their Sins sealed to their Consciences? How infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely would they despise all worldly Honours and Riches in comparison of the peace of Conscience, or one dramme of Grace, one good look from the pleased face of God, would be worth all the world to them? O let it be thus precious to thee now! 'Tis the property of a fool to say, would God I had done this or that, when it is too late. Let every wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearted Christian strive to be such an one now, as he shall wish at that day, that he had been: Cast away every thing, every lust, every desire, every dearest contentment, that may betray thy soule to eternall misery: Remember the words of our blessed Saviour, <hi>Mark.</hi> 9.43. <hi>If thy hand offend thee, Cut it off, if thy foot offend thee, cut it off,</hi> ver. 45. <hi>If thine eye offend thee, pluck it out,</hi> ver 47. <hi>It is better for thee to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Kingdom of God maimed, than having two hands, or two feet, or two eyes, to be cast into Hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched, where the worm dieth not, &amp; the fire is not quench'd.

               <p>AGainst this grand Error, I lay down this fundamental Truth (namely) that <hi>Adam,</hi> by his transgressing of the first Covenant of Life and Obedience, did plunge himself and all his posterity, into a state of Sin and Death, under which they all lie and perish, untill they be redeemed by Christ the second <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this Doctrine there are three Branches distinctly to be observed:<note place="margin">Three Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of it.</note>
               </p>
               <p>First, That God made with <hi>Adam</hi> a Covenant of Life and Obedience.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Adam</hi> brake that Covenant by his Disobedience, and so did bring himself and his posterity into a state of Sin and Death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, That we lie under that state of Sin and Misery, till we be regenerate and planted into Christ, by whom alone we have deliverance from it.</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">
                  <p>Of the first Branch: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> The happinesse of man in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted estate, was established in way of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and it stood of two parts; the one shewing what God commanded and required of <hi>Adam</hi> in way of Duty, and what he would do
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:205094:123"/>for <hi>Adam</hi> upon the performance thereof; the other shewes the Creatures duty, binding himselfe to obey the will of his Creatour in all things: It was a <hi>Covenant</hi> of <hi>works,</hi> wherein Life was promised upon condition of <hi>Adams</hi> perfect and intire obedience, and Death threatned in case of his disobedience. In this Covenant there were some things required, and some things forbidden, with promises and threats annexed, and outward seales added for confirmation: The thing required was intire Obedience: the Promise thereunto annexed, was the Promise of everlasting life; and in token hereof, God gave <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>eat of the tree of Life.</hi> The thing forbidden, was to <hi>eat of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evill:</hi> The threatning annexed, was Death, <hi>In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die;</hi> die everlastingly; and that Tree did serve as a warning to our first Parents, of their mutable condition, and of the danger that would follow upon their transgressing; so sealing the threatning of that Covenant, Gen. 3.11. said God, <hi>who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</hi> There needed nothing else to condem them, they were forced by the only guilt of their own Consciences to <hi>hide themselves from Gods presence,</hi> ver. 8.</p>
                  <p>You see then, first,<note place="margin">What life was promised in the first Covenant.</note> here is a formal Covenant of Life and Death: Secondly, you may observe also, that the first Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had Promises of <hi>life eternall,</hi> Luke 10.25. The question was concerning <hi>life eternall,</hi> how he might <hi>inherit</hi> it; Christ bids him <hi>keep the Commandements,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Levit. 18.5.</note> and he should have his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire; from whence the Inference is clear, that the Promise of Life made to the keeping of the Commandements, was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life: And so much the Lord himself expresseth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.22. when he drove <hi>Adam</hi> out of Paradise, <hi>lest he should put forth his hand and take of the tree of life, and live for ever.</hi> The life then which that Tree did signifie &amp; seal to man, was Life everlasting. And it is used to express that eternal life, which the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Lord shall enjoy for ever in Heaven: Rev. 2.7. <hi>To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God.</hi> Lastly, in this Covenant there was some kind of grace, because God might have required
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:205094:124"/>Obedience at his Creatures hands, without any such promise: Secondly, because that reward to live for ever, was above the merit of <hi>Adams</hi> obedience: Thirdly, especially considering that <hi>Adams</hi> ability to perform that condition of Life, was of Gods own donation; and this is almost as much Grace as some men allow in the new Covenant. Howbeit, this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant was a Covenant of works, a conditional, legal Covenant, because the terms on which the Promise of Life was groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was <hi>Adams</hi> own personal, perfect Obedience; whereas in the new Covenant of Grace it is grounded on, and made good to us for the righteousness of the Mediatour. This was the Covenant of mans Creation, made with all mankind in <hi>Adam</hi> their head, and by it all the world are bound to be holy and perfect, as God made them at first. It was in <hi>Adams</hi> own hand and power to have continued happy by it. This Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant he brake, and forfeited the life therein promised, and brought himself and his posterity under the Curse, as in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Branch is to be declared.</p>

               <div n="2" type="section">
                  <p>Secondly,<note n="2" place="margin">Branch.</note> You see how <hi>Adam</hi> by transgression, brake and forfeited that first Covenant: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> Let us now consider the effects of his Fall, and first upon himself; for he did plunge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a state of sin and misery, which is expressed by that threatning: Gen. 2.17. <hi>Thou shalt surely die.</hi> This threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning taking hold of <hi>Adam,</hi> doth comprehend three things:</p>
                  <p>First,<note n="1" place="margin">His Losses.</note> The loss of his felicity, pack and be gone, no place for a Rebel: Secondly the loss of the Image of God, instead of knowledge,<note place="margin">Eph 4.18. 1 Cor. 2.14. Ephes. 2.1. Rom. 3.23.</note> his <hi>Ʋnderstanding is darkned, not able to discern the things of the spirit of God;</hi> instead of holiness and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness, he is <hi>dead in sins and trespasses,</hi> he <hi>comes short of the glory of God,</hi> he doth <hi>alwaies</hi> in <hi>all</hi> things offend God, being able to do nothing that can please God. <hi>Adam</hi> is now to be driven as an Exile out of Paradise; he must not taste of the Tree of Life.<note place="margin">Gen. 3.10.</note> Thirdly, he lost his sweet Communion with God; he was wont to talk with God, and not to be afraid, but now he <hi>flies</hi> from his <hi>presence,</hi> he was <hi>afraid</hi> when he <hi>heard his voice,</hi> the voice of his God: Guilt, and shame, and fear took hold of the sinning Creature: And thus <hi>Adam</hi> dies in his
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:205094:124"/>Spirit, he hath neither power, wisdome, nor will to do that which is well-pleasing to the Lord; he lost the favour of God, and is now in a state of enmity against God; God and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> were now two, as we say, without any desire or suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency on mans part, to make reconciliation, if the Lord had not looked upon them in the blessed Seed: he lost also his compleat and sweet dominion over the Creatures: These are his losses.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another effect of his Fall upon himself,<note n="2" place="margin">His Corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</note> was that universal Corruption of his Nature in all the powers and faculties of his soul and body: <hi>Adam</hi> now was not like <hi>Adam,</hi> he was not the same man; he was comely, though naked, before the Fall, but now uncomely, as a dead corps is gastly to be beheld, though it were lovely and delightful to us when it was living. They knew evil now experimentally; <hi>Adams</hi> Fall did bring, not onely a privation of goodness, but a contrary evil disposition upon the whole man; as Sickness is not onely an absence of Health, but a malignant quality seizing on the Spirits, bringing an evil habit of Body: Mans sin is not onely that transgression of <hi>Adam,</hi> whereby he sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned against God, and we with him: but another which ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth out of this, even that infection of all the powers and members, both of soul and body, whereby we are inclined to evil, and that continuallly, which as Poyson put into a cup of Wine doth make it deadly, dispersing it self throughout the same: In like manner <hi>Adams</hi> first Sin did poyson his whole Nature, so that no sound part is found in him, from the crown of the Head to the sole of the Foot. His Understanding is filled with blindness, and darkness, and savoureth not the things which are of God. His Conscience is wounded with guilt, having lost both its Purity and Peace. His Will is cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and of no strength to do good, &amp;c. And from this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Fountain, did issue a stream of actual Sins in the course of their lives: How many sins did presently appear in their carriage towards God? they excused and cloaked their sin; <hi>Adam</hi> puts it upon his <hi>Wife,</hi> and she upon the <hi>Serpent:</hi> They <hi>hide</hi> and <hi>flie from God,</hi> they alledge a false cause of their <hi>feare</hi> (namely) their <hi>nakednesse;</hi> whereas it was their <hi>eating of the
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:205094:125"/>Forbidden Tree,</hi> that made them <hi>afraid;</hi> they betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to false Coverts, they sewed <hi>Fig-leaves</hi> to hide their <hi>nakednesse;</hi> But how to recover the favour of God, they had no knowledge. Thus it was with our first Parents when they had sinned.</p>
                  <p>There is yet a third effect of their Fall,<note n="3" place="margin">Death.</note> and that is Death: By Sin an entry was made unto Death, to the dissolution of Nature.<note place="margin">1 Before our dissolution. Gen. 3.19.</note>
                     <hi>Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which sentence of <hi>death</hi> are comprehended all the sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and miseries of this life, the fore-runners of death, as may be gathered from the Lords proceeding in his sentence against <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 3.17, 18, 19.</note>
                     <hi>Cursed is the ground for thy sake, in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the daies of thy life, thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field</hi> (as the Beasts of the earth did) and shalt no longer eat of the Fruits of Paradise, <hi>in the swet of thy face thou shalt eat bread, till thou return to the ground for out of it thou wast taken.</hi>

Would you fain know the reasons of this? Can you not content your selves to know, that it is so, unlesse you know the manner how it is so?

                     <hi>(inasmuch) as all have sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> must be understood in that one man, for else many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands die, which had never sinned, which is contrary to the expresse words of this Text, and of the verses following, where the Apostle proves that all sinned in that one man: Observe the Apostle's reasoning, v. 13. <hi>Ʋntill the law</hi> (namely of <hi>Moses) sin was in the world,</hi> and therefore a Law which was transgressed, because <hi>where there is no Law Sin is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> there is no transgression: Again observe, that the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of that Law brought Death; so ver. 14. <hi>Death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moses; if there were no Sin, nor a Law broken from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> there would have been no Death: Now what Law was that? It was the Law of our Creation, which <hi>Adam</hi> brake: And what Sin was there from <hi>Adam</hi>'s time that caused Death? Answ. Not onely Actual Sin, which is called <hi>a sinning after the similitude of</hi> Adams <hi>transgression,</hi> but Original Sin, wherein Infants are born, and for which they die; for so it is said, <hi>Death reigned over them that had not sinned after the similitude of</hi> Adams <hi>transgression</hi> (that is) actually; they never sinned by their own Act in their own Persons, yet they die; What follows of that? Therefore they sinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom all mankind received the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Death, according to that of the Apostle, 1 Corinth. 15.22. <hi>In</hi> Adam <hi>all die, therefore in</hi> Adam <hi>all sinned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.15. It is delivered as an undoubted truth, <hi>Through the offence of one, many be dead:</hi> Are these empty sounds? Are they not plain words of truth? Then let us ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up this Argument. The thing to be proved was this, That <hi>Adam</hi> did plunge all his Posterity into a state of Sin and
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:205094:126"/>Death: This is proved by the words of the Text, <hi>By one man sin</hi> and <hi>death entred into the world:</hi> How so? <hi>Because in him all sinned:</hi> How does that appear? because no man dies that has not sinned; yet Infants die, that never sinned in their own person by their own act. And is that just? Yes, because the Law of their Creation was broken by their Father <hi>Adam;</hi> therefore <hi>through the offence of one, many be dead.</hi>

                  <p>First, <hi>Legally,</hi> as head of that first Covenant,<note place="margin">All were in <hi>Adam</hi> legally.</note> with him and his Posterity that were to come of his loynes; God entred into a Covenant of Life and Obedience; <hi>Adam</hi> was not a private man in this business, he and his children were to stand or fall according to the tenour of that Covenant: he recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the grace, the mercy, and promises of that Covenant, and strength to perform it, for all, and so he forfeited the same for all: Even as in our Law, a Landlord does contract with his Tenant for himself and children, to hold such and such Lands, under such and such Conditions; the which, if the Father forfeit, he forfeits the whole Estate that was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both from himself and children. Thus we see also, that God doth imply Children with their Parents in other Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants and Promises, as he <hi>promised</hi> the <hi>Land</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to his <hi>seed</hi> after him for a <hi>Possession,</hi> when as yet he had <hi>no child,</hi> Acts 7.5.

God made a Covenant with <hi>Israel, with the Captaines of your Tribes, your Elders, and your Officers, with all the men of</hi> Israel, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. and <hi>with your little ones,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>and not with them onely that stand here with us this day before the Lord, but also with him that is not here with us this day,</hi> that is, with the Children that shall be born.
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:205094:127"/>And if Parents may contract for their Children, yea, seeing God himself doth take into the same Covenant, the Fathers and their Children, why should it seem strange that he should do the like to <hi>Adam</hi> and his seed, especially considering, that he was the Root in whom all mankind was created, and out of which all mankind was to spring in their generations, in him we all had our beeing, as in the seed, and the principles of our future existence; forasmuch then as Children are parts of their Parents, and seeing we were parties to that first Covenant, which is broken, we are born <hi>rei debendi,</hi> though not <hi>agendi;</hi> we owe a debt of Obedience, which we cannot perform, and so may blame our selves for breach of Covenant, and God is just.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note n="2" place="margin">Naturally.</note> We were in <hi>Adam naturally;</hi> we were in his loyns, as a part of him, when he fell, so that whatsoever alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration befell the Humane Nature, it is common to us of which Nature we are apart: All the seed of man was in <hi>Adam,</hi> and therefore that seed being wholly corrupted, we that come of him must needs be corrupted also: All the branches of an Oak, all its leaves and boughes were in the root, though when the tree was first planted, not any one of them did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.<note place="margin">Rom. 11.16.

                     </label> God gave to <hi>Adam</hi> an ability to encrease and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply his kind by Generation; Gen. 1.28. <hi>Be fruitfull and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply, and replenish the earth,</hi> as he did unto other Creatures: and so man doth beget man, the whole man begets the whole man consisting of Soul and body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, So likewise for the seate of sin, we say, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Soul alone, nor the Body alone, but the whole man (which consisteth of both, and differeth from both) is the subject or seat of sin: The soul was not Created out of the body, but in the Body, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.1. <hi>God formeth the spirit of man within him,</hi> and so Soul and Body make one man, so that the Body without the Soul,<note place="margin">

It is an idle fancy, to say, that the soule is infected from the body, or the body from the soule; but both are infected from <hi>Adam,</hi> from whom, by the Law, or decree of Propagation, and natural Generation, the whole man hath its beginning: Gen. 5.3. <hi>Adam begat a son in his own likenesse;</hi> a Son consisting of soule and body, in his own likenesse, that is, in his sinfull likenesse; for <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one:</hi> Job 14.4. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, we receive three evils from <hi>Adams</hi> Fall (namely) first, Imputation of his Sin; secondly, Corruption of our Nature; And, thirdly, Death.</p>
                  <p>First, For imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> Disobedience:<note n="1" place="margin">Imputation of his Sin.</note> The Text is expressed, Rom. 5 16. <hi>The judgement was by one</hi> (offence) <hi>to condemnation.</hi> In this place <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, as the two head-men of mankind, in their diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent estate of Nature and Grace: <hi>Adam</hi> was the naturall head of all men; <hi>Christ</hi> is the head of the spirituall off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring. They agree in this property of communicating their conditions to those, who are theirs; <hi>Adam</hi> is the head of Sin and Death, <hi>Christ</hi> is the head of Righteousnesse and Life, as in the present Text, <hi>Judgement was by one to Condemnation,</hi> that is, that one Offence was imputed to all to Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; so the free gift is of many offences unto justification:
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:205094:128"/>Christ takes away the condemnation which that sin brought. O then, but what shall we do for all our Actual sins? The Text shews you, Christ doth take away not only that offence, but all our personall sins too, <hi>The free Gift is of many Offences unto Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stication;</hi> many offences are freely forgiven, and all our other sins shall not be imputed to us. The comparison is this, As <hi>Adams</hi> offence is ours by imputation, it was imputed for Condemnation; so Christs righteousnesse is ours by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is imputed unto Justification, see ver. 18. <hi>As by the offence of one, judgement came upon all men to condemnation; even so, by the righteousnesse of one, the free gist came upon all to justification of life.</hi>

                  <p>Before I passe to the third Evil received by <hi>Adam,</hi> two Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections come to be cleared:</p>

                     <hi>The Image of God in</hi> Adam <hi>was an humane perfection onely, say some.</hi> Adam <hi>was made a reasonable, wise, and understanding man; He was in a perfect, morall, sinlesse condition; but if we could attain the perfection that was in</hi> Adam, <hi>it would be no more than a morall and humane perfection; they that have but the first</hi> Adams <hi>wisdome, are still of the earth, earthly.

                  <p>But to answer the Objection, the Scripture is clear, that the Image of God in <hi>Adam</hi> did consist chiefly and properly in a Conformity to the Nature and Will of God in <hi>holinesse</hi> and <hi>righteousnesse,</hi> as the Apostle teacheth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.23, 24. <hi>Be ye renued in the spirit of your minde, and put on that new man, which after God is created in righteousnesse and true holinesse;</hi> with Col. 3.10. <hi>and have put on the new man, which is renued in knowledge, after the Image of him that created him.</hi> Note three things:</p>
                  <p>First, The <hi>old man</hi> to be put off with his deeds, is our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Nature in <hi>Adam,</hi> the Flesh with its affections and lusts: The <hi>new man</hi> to be put on, is the new Creature, or the Graces of the Spirit; it is that universall purity, which is begun in the souls of the regenerate, by the working of the Spirit, whereby our naturall corruption is more and more subdued, and our souls indued with holy qualities, according to the Image of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, We are said to be <hi>renued unto this Image,</hi> which gives us to understand, that sometime we had it: That which is renued, is the same that was at first bestowed; the spirit of Renovation doth restore us what we received in our Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was lost; whatsoever is renued was once had, and lost: Now our renovation by Christ stands in knowledge in the spirit of our mind and in righteousnesse, and true holinesse; therefore in those qualities stood the Image of God in our first creation</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Which is yet more plain, by the words of both Texts,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.24. Col. 3.10.</note> which say, that <hi>the new man is created in righteousnesse and holinesse after God,</hi> that is, after the likenesse of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, who did create him; God created <hi>Adam,</hi> we are renued after the Image of the Creatour, and that was in Knowledge, Righteousnesse and Holinesse: <hi>Adam</hi> could not lose that which he never had; <hi>Adam</hi> lost spirituall Life, Holinesse and Righteousnesse, therefore he had them.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>but not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Natures from the Birth: some speak of Originall sin, as a great infelicity, not a sinne: As for a Child to be borne with one eye, or withered arme, we say it is his infelicity,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:205094:129"/>but not his sin, or fault: Are we to think so slightly of Originall sinnes?</hi>

Indeed, carnall men make light of this corruption of Nature, because they do not feel it. <hi>Paul</hi> was alive in his own conceit; he was sinfull, though he knew it not, sinfull by nature, <hi>before the Commandement came,,</hi> but discerned not his wofull state and spirituall bondage, under corruption, till <hi>the Commandement</hi> came to his knowledge; then he played <hi>Rex</hi> and <hi>slew</hi> him, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. And in this respect, we all have cause to bewaile, not our Weaknesse, but our Wickednesse, and to pray, not onely for Strength, but for Mercy, to pardon and cleanse us from our Birth-sin, as <hi>David</hi> did;<note place="margin">Psal. 51.7.</note> and to strive, not onely to keep our selves unspotted of grosse sins, but to be regenerated and born again, else we are undone for ever.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> Christ alone needed no regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because he was not conceived and born in sin, as all others are: But <hi>except we be born again, we cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven.</hi>

This is our case in relation to <hi>Adam,</hi> we are all wicked Sons of a wicked Father, there is none of us that doth good, no not one: All <hi>Adams</hi> Sons are inwrapped in his sin, all are under that common guilt: bring forth a clean Son out of <hi>Adams</hi> loyns, and he shall live: there is <hi>duplex reatus, proprius, &amp; communis,</hi> I am guilty of some sins, which another is not, and another is guilty of sins which I am not; we have our proper faults. But this <hi>one offence,</hi> of which <hi>Paul</hi> speaks, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 16, 19. doth involve us all in one common guilt; by it all of us being in <hi>Adams</hi> loyns, are alike guilty; and therefore even by that rule <hi>(The soule that sinneth it shall die)</hi> we must all die, because we all have sinned. <hi>Sicut omnium ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum natura, ita etiam omnium voluntas originaliter fuit in Adamo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the kind of death which God threatned to the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> we see it is First, a temporall death, for infants die daily; And grant that <hi>Adams</hi> sin brought but a temporall death on his Children, yet this proveth that they were sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and guilty in <hi>Adam,</hi> else they should not have died: And unlesse you confesse, that Infants are sinners in <hi>Adam,</hi> ye cannot maintaine the justice of God for killing Infants with temporall death, according to that rule, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.20. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If you grant Infants to be Sinners in <hi>Adam,</hi> then it will follow, that the same <hi>death,</hi> which is <hi>the wages of sin,</hi> is

                  <p>Thirdly, Againe, consider what death it is that Christ doth deliver us from, that kinde of death must be confessed to be due to sin, as its wages: But Christ doth deliver us not onely from a Temporall death in our Resurrection, but from Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting death in Hell, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Even Jesus, which delivered us from the wrath to come,</hi> so Ro. 5.9. <hi>Being justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him:</hi> After Death now comes the Judgement: Now to what end should Christ judge the dead, if there were no other death than the dissolution of our soules from the body? But there is another Death, which is an everlasting separation from the presence of God. 2 Thes. 1.8, 9. <hi>He shall come in flames of fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord.</hi> To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, <hi>Adam,</hi> by his Sin, deprived himself of Paradise; it is true, but not an earthly Paradise onely; he did plunge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self into a state of death, not onely temporall, but in Hell: And they that can dispute against this truth now, shall be forced to confesse it hereafter, and to bewaile themselves for what <hi>Adam</hi> did before they were born, unlesse Christ redeeme them:</p>

                     </label> 'Tis not the Wisdome of <hi>Plato,</hi> the Learning of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> nor the Justice of <hi>Aristides,</hi> &amp;c. Nor all the Honesty, and seeming Vertues of those Heathen Worthies; 'Tis not all the morall Honesty, and Civility of Christians, nor their outward priviledges in Christianity. 'Tis not any or all of this can serve the turne, whatsoever is short of Christ, whatsoever is short of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is short of Salvation: 'Tis nothing but Christ the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom the new Covenant of Grace is establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that can deliver a man from the state of Sin and Misery, in which all are borne.</p>
                  <p>It doth offend the Eares of many, especially Scholars to heare us say, that those antient Philosophers and searchers of Wisdome, that all that ever be born of <hi>Adam,</hi> whether Turks, Pagans, or Christians be under Sin and Death. They cannot conceive that men of such Honesty, and Devotion in their way should be Damned; They cry out against this
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:205094:133"/>Doctrine, as harsh and uncharitable. But whats the reason hereof? Surely because they doe not well understand, or not remember the Nature of the Covenant of workes, and the state of all men under it, till they be actually planted into Christ: Men doe not consider under what Covenant they are, they doe not heare the voice of that Covenant, shutting up all under wrath, who doe not performe absolute, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, personal, and sinlesse obedience; the Covenant of workes, knowes no Mercy, it curseth every Transgression; it accepts not of Repentance, nor of doing our best, all men out of Christ are <hi>under the Law,</hi> (that is) under these strict termes, to <hi>doe it,</hi> or <hi>dye.</hi> Indeed if Salvation were disposed and bestowed according to mens good Intentions, or morall Honesty, or the like good workes, then there were hope of moral Heathens, Turkes, Papists, and meerly civilized Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants; But poor Souls all this while, ye look for Salvation in the Covenant of works;<note place="margin">1 John 5.12. Rom. 8.1.</note> know therefore for certaine, that <hi>He that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son, hath not life. There is no Condemnation to them that be in Christ Jesus,</hi> and nothing but Condemnation to them that be out of Christ: A man may really be under the Law, and but seemingly under Grace; many thousands doe apply to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the promises of the Gospel, and of the new Covenant, when as they are not gotten one step out of old <hi>Adam,</hi> when as they are still under the Law; you must look to it, that your state be changed, that ye be translated from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Nature to Jesus Christ effectually, and then you are under Grace, then are ye free indeed, Christ restores us all that we lost in <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the first <hi>Adam,</hi> I told you we have three evills. First, Imputation of his transgression; Secondly, Corruption of our Nature;<note place="margin">Three good things by Christ.</note> Thirdly, Death. Answerable whereunto, we have three good things by Christ; First, Imputation of his Righteousnesse; Secondly, Renuing of Nature; Thirdly, Life. These things are evidently set forth in that Comparison, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes between Christ and <hi>Adam, Rom.</hi> 5.14.</p>
                  <p>First, For imputation of Christs Righteousnesse, <hi>v.</hi> 16.18. <hi>The judgement was by one offence to condemnation, but the free
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:205094:133"/>gift is of many offences to justification;</hi> and ver. 18. <hi>As by the offence of one, judgement came upon all to condemnation, even so by the righteousnesse of one, the free gift came upon all men to justification of life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, for renuing of our Nature, Christ makes <hi>new Creatures;</hi> We are <hi>circumcised in him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17.</note>
                     <hi>with the Circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh; and you being dead in your sint, and the uncircumcision of your flesh, hath he quickned together with him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2.11, 13.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Lastly for Life, <hi>Rom</hi> 5.17. <hi>Much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousnesse, shall reigne in life by one Jesus Christ;</hi> And again ver. 21. <hi>As sin hath reigned unto Death, even so might grace reigne through righteousnesse unto eternall life by Jesus Christ our Lord:</hi> In which comparison of Christ and <hi>Adam,</hi> ye see that we gain in Christ what we lost in <hi>Adam:</hi> Grace is as powerfull to save, as Sin to destroy: Guilt by <hi>Adam,</hi> Righteousnesse by Christ; Corruption by <hi>Adam,</hi> Regeneration by Christ; Death by <hi>Adam,</hi> Eternall Life by Christ: where for conclusion, I would have this one thing diligently noted in this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Christ with <hi>Adam</hi> (namely) that our Redemption by Christ, is a sure proof of our undoing by <hi>Adam:</hi> Now take away the former, the transgression of all men in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ye overthrow the latter, to wit, the Redemption of the world by Christ: if any did not fall in <hi>Adam,</hi> they need no redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption by Christ; but seeing all need to be redeemed by Christ, therefore all fell in <hi>Adam,</hi> which is the substance of the truth delivered against the Hereticall Position laid down in the <hi>Lond. Test.</hi> above.</p>
                  <p>That which remains is by way of use, to humble every soul of us under the sense of our cursed estate in Nature; <label type="milestone">

                     </label> To make us to observe the crossings, the rebellings, the untowardnesse, and indisposition that is in our hearts against the will of God: It is evident, that we are born in sin, because we need not be taught to sin, as we are taught every Art, that is not naturall, we must be taught to read, to write, to work in this or that Art, but we sin without teaching, as the young Snake doth hisse and sting.</p>

                  <p>We should repent and bewaile our Originall corruption, especially the lustings and workings of our old man, with the several aggravations thereof:</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. In regard of its Closenesse, and Adherence to us, as close as our Flesh, as our Members; It doth cast a contagion and defilement upon our best actions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In regard of its Strength, and Power to hinder Good, to incline to Evil.</p>

                  <p n="5">5. In regard of its Fruitfulnesse, continually it worketh in us to bring forth fruit unto death.</p>

It is it which doth cost the Ministers of Christ more pains to convince people of it, to make them sensible of their state in it, than of any of their other Actuall sins: Men are not easily convinced of their naturall Blindnesse, Ignorance, Unbelief, Hypocrisie, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, hardnesse and deceitfulnesse of Heart, and that Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roll of lusts and wickednesse, that is in the best civiliz'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man or woman in the world: O that God, which raised Christ from the dead, would by the same mighty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his Spirit, quicken every soul among you, that is dead in sins and trespasses, and make you to lay it to your hearts, that if you be not better than Nature made you, you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever, that if you be not regenerated, you are under

                  <hi>Breath, or Soule, are subject to the Grave, as well as the Body or Flesh; for Christs Soule, as well as his Flesh, was in Hell, that is, the Grave, or bonds of Death, so that he wholly died for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For this matter will now fitly be handled, <hi>infra</hi> cap. 18. wherein is expresly handled, the Doctrine of the future state of mens souls onely. To affirm that his Soul was in the Grave as well as his Flesh, is contrary to those Scriptures, which te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie that Christ our Mediatour, at his death, yeilded up the Ghost, <hi>commending</hi> his <hi>Spirit</hi> into the hands of his <hi>Father</hi> (as <hi>Stephen</hi> did) promising the converted Thiefe, that <hi>the same day he should be with him in Paradise,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 27.50. Luke 23.46. Ver. 43.</note> Luke 23.43. which surely is not the Grave. His body onely was taken downe from the Tree, and laid in a Sepulchre: And whereas it is said, that <hi>Christs soul was not left in Hell,</hi> Acts 2.31.<note place="margin">Acts 13.29. Acts 2.31.</note> the text expounds it self of the <hi>Resurrection of Christ,</hi> for S. <hi>Peter</hi> comparing <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Christ</hi> together, saith, that <hi>David is both dead and buried, and his Sepulchre is with us unto this day; David</hi> is not risen from the Grave, his
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:205094:135"/>body sees corruption: but of Christ it is said, that <hi>his soule was not left in Hell, neither did his flesh see corruption: Soule</hi> then in this place cannot be taken properly for the spirituall part of Man, but for the life of Christ, as it is expressed, ver. 24. <hi>Whom God raised up from the dead, having loosed the paines of death</hi> (that is, the power of Death, and bonds of the Grave) <hi>because it was not possible that he should be holden of it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third Error is scarce fit to be repeated, <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Error. </seg>3</label> it is surely the foam of a distemperd Brain; for what sober man would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, <hi>That Christ ascended upwards from the earth, into some part of the celestiall Bodies, and that without doubt he must be in the most excellent, glorious, and heavenly part thereof, which is the sunne?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Poeticall wits make sport with a man in the Moon; But did it ever enter into the heart of a Christian, to think that the body of Christ is in the Sun? The Scripture teacheth us to speak more soberly and reverently of that Article and Mystery of our Faith (namely) <hi>That our Lord Christ,</hi>

                  <p>Here, for conclusion, note that one's redemption may be procured two manner of waies, either by strong hand; or else by a price paid: In the former way Christ hath redeemed us out of the hand of the Devil (namely) not by giving any price or satisfaction to him,<note place="margin">Col. 2.15.</note> but by strong hand; Christ conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Devil, <hi>he spoyled Principalities and Powers,</hi> and so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered us out of his hand by way of rescue,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> as <hi>Abraham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scued <hi>Lot</hi> out of the hands of <hi>Chedarlaomer,</hi> who had taken him Prisoner: Christ did <hi>bind</hi> that <hi>strong man,</hi> and so delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us as a prey out of his teeth: but he was to deal otherwise with God, not by way of force, but by way of a price paid to the justice of God; he delivered us from his wrath to come, without which satisfactory price, Life and Salvation could never be procured to our poor Souls; and therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the inheritance of the Saints in Heaven, <hi>a purchased Pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session,</hi> Eph. 1.14. And again, he is said <hi>to purchase his Church with his own Blood,</hi> Acts 20.28 Now if Christ did purchase his Church by his Blood, and <hi>ransome our Sins by his Blood,</hi> Eph. 1.7. and <hi>purchased the heavenly Inheritance by his Blood,</hi> v. 14. How say these men, that Christ did not purchase Life &amp; Salvation, no not for the Elect? Christ doth not onely hold forth Love and Life, but he did first purchase it, and then held it forth; he was first offered for Sinners, and then offered to Sinners by the Gospel; <hi>This word God sent unto the hildren of</hi> Israel <hi>preaching peace by Jesus Christ,</hi> Acts 10.36. <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day, and that Repentance and Remission of sins should be preached in his Name amongst a. Nations,</hi> Luke 24.46, 47.</p>
                  <p>So if the Question be,<note place="margin">Application.</note> whether Christ did purchase Love and Life for the Elect? The Answer is, first, that he did purchase the love of Reconciliation for Sinners, though not the love of Gods Grace which gave Christ. And secondly, this Purchase was made by a Price satisfactory, and of value answerable to the souls redeemed; and the Inheritance purchased, a Price, I say, paid not to Sathan, but to the Justice of God.</p>

               <p>YOu have seen how Christ hath purchased Life, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Salvation, and Remission of Sins: The next great question is, for whom he hath done all this, whether for all men whatsoever, or for his Church onely.</p>
               <p>The Errors noted in the <hi>London Testimony,</hi> pag. 9, 10. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Error. </seg>1</label> are these especially; <hi>First, That Christ was given to satisfie for the sin of</hi> Adam, <hi>and for all the sins of all mankinde: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That Christ intended the benefits of his death (namely) remission of sins, and eternall life to all, even to those who draw back to perdition, as well as for those who believe to the saving of the soule.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Those other words (namely) <hi>that if Christ died onely for some, and yet God commanded the Gospel to be preached to all,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>then God commands a lie to be preached to the most part of men; and that they take away the true Gospel and ground of Faith, and introduce a false Gospell, which affords men no ground to believe.</hi> Those words, I say, are rather Arguments to prove the former opinions than a distinct opinion from them; and so they shall be considered in the Answer.</p>
               <p>The third Error (namely) is, <hi>That though Heathens,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
                  <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, and Devils, have for a time damned themselves, yet by the Covenant of generall Redemption, our God will deliver those Prisoners out of the pit of Hell; and they, with those few that are Believers, shall feele and possesse in due time the blessednesse of it, to their everlasting salvation and comfort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Error (namely) of the Redemption and possibility of saving the Damned, hath been confuted already: Never did the greatest Patrons of generall Redemption extend the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it to finally impenitent persons, much less to the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:205094:138"/>it being so flat against the Scripture, which saith, that <hi>He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him,</hi> John 3.36. and if they be once damned, their state is unchangeable, if the soul be once lost, <hi>What shall a man give in exchange for his soule?</hi> Mat. 16.26. There is <hi>no redemption from Hell.</hi>

               <p>My businesse therefore will be to help your Understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in the two Branches of the former Opinions (namely) concerning Christs SAtisfaction by his Death upon the Cross,<note place="margin">The state of the Question.</note> for all the Sins of all Mankind; And concerning the intention of the Father and the Son, (namely) that all should partake of the benefits thereof, even the damned.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Redemption, Reconciliation, and Satisfaction, is nothing else but the pacifying of a party offended by some action or suffering, wherewith the party offended is satisfied so far forth, as that he will receive into favour the party offending; hence it is, that the Elect, seeing God intirely loves them, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be said to be redeemed, or reconciled; neither is there any neede of Reconciliation for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Reconciliationem hanc sive propitiationem, Actionem Jesu Christi esse statuimus, quâ justitiae Divinae, quae obstacule erat quo minus peccatores sine ullâ odii contra peccatum Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione in gratiam secum recipere vellet, satisfactum est.

                  <p n="2">2. This Reconciliation is the worke of Christ, whereby he hath satisfied Gods justice, and removed that impediment, which hindered the Actuall receiving of sinners into favour, till God had shewed his hatred against sinne: The effect of this work of Christ is the impetration and procuring of Gods favour, by which impetration or obtaining of Gods favour, we doe understand an actual restoring of all men into peace with God; But the restoring of them into a Condition or Estate, in which God may now, without wronging his Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, communicate of his Grace unto us, and is ready to doe it upon such Termes and Conditions, as himselfe shall li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and appoint.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. Those Terms and Conditions, are Faith and Obedience, required and established under promises of Mercy, and threatnings of Punishment, this being the condition of our Reconciliation, it is possible, and not against the Nature of the Covenant, that the Benefit of this Grace obtained for all, shall not be enjoyed by any of them, for whom it was obtained and intended, because all and every one may resist
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:205094:139"/>the Command of God, requiring of them Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, through their owne wilfulnesse and wickednesse.

                  <p n="4">4. That effect of Christs death, which we call purchased or procured reconciliation doth pertain to all and every man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently, without any difference of Time or Age, or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, or Places, in so much, that all men whatsoever are for Christs sake, in such respect with God, that first, he will punish none of them, with eternall Death for the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> onely: secondly, that God will reject none of them that be called for any of their Actuall sinnes committed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:205094:140"/>their calling, but he will have mercy upon them all, if they actually repent and believe, and amend their lives: Thirdly, that God will not condemn any of them that believe in Christ, for their daily sins of infirmity and weaknesse: But such, and onely such, as by their new and wilfull obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, do spurn at the Grace offered, and despise their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, they judge themselves unworthy of eternall life, and do justly deprive themselves of the benefit of that Grace which was purchased and procured for them; because they would not believe in Christ, when as by the help of Grace they could, they are deservedly deprived of the mercy which Christ procured for them, and make themselves guilty of their own just condemnation.</p>
                  <p>By this short draught of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrine, you may perceive from what corrupt Fountain these new and bitter Streames of false Doctrines have flowed: And it may serve to make us bewaile the giddinesse, partiality, and undiscer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning spirit of our people, who in the compasse of ten or twelve yeares, cry down Arminianisme in a party, against whom they are prejudiced, and cry it up again, and admire it,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.1.</note> when it is set forth in an Independent dresse: Most peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The particular Errors of this Declaration will fall under consideration, in handling of the main Question, which now follows.</p>
                  <p>Against the two Errors before-mentioned, I oppose these two positions as the most certain Doctrine of the Scripture: (namely) First, Christ was not given to satisfie for all the sins of all mankind; the price of Redemption was not paid for all and every man, that is, in their room and stead; his blood was not shed to satisfie the justice of God, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Reconciliation and Remission for the sins of them that perish, as well as of them that be saved.</p>
                  <p>The second is, That Christ in dying, intended a spirituall benefit to his Church; neither was it the intention of God the Father in giving his Son, nor of his Son in laying down his life, that all and every man should be redeemed by it.</p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:205094:140"/>
                  <p>For proof of the former, I offer these Reasons; First, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Position. </seg>1</label> they which are reconciled by Christs Death, are saved by his Life: <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Rom</hi> 5.10. So S. <hi>Paul, If when we were enemies we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God by the death o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <hi>Christ paid a Ransome for all, even for them that perish, but they, through unbelie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e, did not apply it.</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is no Solution to the Argument, but a farther Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> shewing a reason why all are not ransomed by the price of Christs Death (namely) because it is not given to all to believe on the Son of God: if it were paid for all, then should all be set free: for what wise man will pay a great price for a Captive, if he knows for certain, that the Prisoner shall receive no benefit by it? Deliverance of the Captive is the very end wherefore his ransome was paid, and therefore seeing that end is not enjoyed by all, we gather, that is was not paid for all: Christ wil not lose the price of his own blood, <hi>Those whom thou gavest me, I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition,</hi> and he is lost,<note place="margin">John 17.27.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was not given to me to save: Of that distinction between the Impetration, or procuring of Reconciliation for all, and the Application thereof, I shall speak anon.</p>
                  <p>My second Reason is this, The wrath of God remains on them that perish, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>2</label> therefore they were never redeemed from it: Conceive it thus, To die for one,<note place="margin">John 3.30.</note> is by his own death to free another from death, To die <hi>ejus loco, &amp; vice,</hi> in his room and stead, that the other may live, as 2 <hi>Sam</hi> 18.33. <hi>Would God I had died for thee, O</hi> Absalon, <hi>my son, my son;</hi> that is, ô that I had died, and thou hadst lived, that my life had gone for thine. Thus Christ died for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5 6 8. <hi>While we were yet sinners Christ died for us,</hi> (that is) to deliver us from death, according as it is written, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse, being made a curse for us;</hi> Christ being made a Curse for us, does remove the Curse from us; but if the Curse doth still rest on us, it is because he was not made a Curse for us: God doth punish the sins of the Elect upon the person of Christ, but the sins of others, that do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:205094:141"/>in their own persons, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.24. therefore if any do bear the punishment in his own person, it is a sign that Christ hath not born it for him. If any be cast into Prison, till he pay the utmost Farthing, it is a sign that Christ the Surety, has not paid the Debt for him. The Argument may be thus fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, None of those for whom Christ died, are condemned: <hi>Who shall condemn? It is Christ that died,</hi> Rom. 8.34. The force of that Consolation is this, That none of those for whom Christ died are condemned: but there be many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands that are condemned, therefore there be thousands for whom Christ died not.</p>
                  <p>My third Argument is taken from the falshoods and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>3</label> which follow upon this Arminian Doctrine: For if Christ died to satisfie for all men a like, promiscuously and indifferently, as they are the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind is alike redeemed, and restored into a state of Grace by the merit of his Death; then this is done either actually, and absolutely, or under condition of Faith: if actually and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then none could perish, be they Turks, Pagans, Infidels: but this the Arminians themselves disclaim; they teach, that though remission of sins be procured, merited, and acquired for all, yet none partake thereof actually, but Believers: if conditionally, that is, for so many of them as will believe in the Redeemer, then it will follow, that possibly Christs death may be in vain, and so instead of dying for all, he dyed for none, because (say they) Christs work in dying is perfect in every respect; <hi>Etiamsi impetrata redemptio nulli individuo, actu ipso, fuisset applicata;</hi> though no particular man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the world, were ever saved by it: But grant that some do fulfill the conditions of the new Covenant, yet of this Doctrine of Christs dying for all, and not saving all, for whom he died, it will follow, that Christ died in vain, and shed his Blood in vain, and in vain procured Reconciliation for the greatest part of mankind, seeing the greatest part of mankind are not Believers: Now it is grosse to affirme, that Christ died in vain, either for all, or for the greatest part of men; that opinion is not to be admitted, which makes Christ to have died in vain (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17.) <hi>If Christ be not
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:205094:141"/>raised, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your sins;</hi> but so doth this Doctrine, it makes Christ to have died in vain, if not in respect of all, yet of the greatest part of mankind: that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is not to be received, which denies Christs speciall love to them for whom he died (for <hi>greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends,</hi> John 15.13.) But so doth this opinion for Universal Redemption; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it follows, that Christ died for some, whom he did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely love; hereof it will follow, that <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> are as truely redeemed by Christ, and as much beholding to Christ for his death, as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Abel;</hi> for by this Doctrine, Christ has done his part for all alike; he intended Salvation no more to one than to another; he died not for any man or woman by name, but for all in generall, which is contrary to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2.20. <hi>Christ loved me, and gave himselfe for me,</hi> the <hi>Redeemed</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> are <hi>called by their Names.</hi> Isaiah 43.1. <hi>I have formed thee, I have blotted out thy transgressions as a cloud;</hi> The Lord knoweth all his creatures whom he hath formed and made, so also whom he hath redeemed. <hi>Isa.</hi> 44.21, 22. And they are a peculiar people culled out of the world, as in that Thansgiving-song, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Thou hast redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med us to God by thy Blood out of every kinred, and tongue, and people, and nation,</hi> and <hi>marked</hi> or <hi>sealed us up for the Lords people.</hi> Rev. 7.5. Of such a Tribe so many, yea, <hi>Christ calleth his own sheep by name,</hi> John 10.3. their names are written in the Lambs Book of Life, therefore to say, that Christ died for some, whom he did not intirely love, or that he intirely loved any that are damned, or that his Sheep can be plucked out of his hand, and perish everlastingly, is a base reproach to our blessed Redeemer. It gives the lie to the Scripture, and yet is the undeniable consequent of their Doctrine. Thus much for the proof of my first Position.</p>
                  <p>Now because the Scriptures speaking of Redemption, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased by Christs Death, do sometimes expresse it in most large terms, as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Christ Jesus gave himself a ransome for all;</hi> and so <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. that <hi>he by the grace of God should tast death for every man:</hi> Here is <hi>all,</hi> and <hi>every man;</hi> and that place 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:205094:142"/>ours onely, but for the sins of the whole world.</hi> Sometimes again, the Scripture speaks of Redemption in a more limited manner, as that Christ laid down his life <hi>for his friends,</hi> John 15.13. for his Sheep, John 10.15. for his <hi>Church,</hi> Ephes. 5.25. <hi>Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now that you may have your senses exercised to discern Good and Evill, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Distinction. </seg>
                     </label> Truth and Error in this point, you must di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish between the <hi>sufficiency,</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of Christs Death; we do say, that Christ died sufficiently for all, but not effectually for all, for that were an absurd manner of speech; But thus we say, that the Death of Christ is that one onely, and perfect Sacrifice, Oblation, and Satisfaction for sins, in which God is well pleased with man, and by which God intended to save all that come unto him; and it is in it self of infinite value and price, abundantly sufficient to take away the sins of the whole world; and if any perish, it is not through the weaknesse and insufficiency of that sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, but through their own unbelief; by mans own default it proves uneffectuall unto the salvation of many: This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon soveraign Medicine of Souls made of Christs Blood, must be embraced and applied, else it availes not; it is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall onely to them that believe.</p>
                  <p>According to the first Branch of this distinction,<note place="margin">How Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.</note> we teach, that Redemption by Christs Death, is univerfall in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</p>
                  <p>First, For the Price and Merit of it: In Christs Sacrifice there is merit enough for all the sins that ever were, or shall be committed; yea, if there were ten thousand worlds to be redeemed; they needed no other Price, no other Satisfaction to please God, God is fully contented with this one of his Son: For it being the Death of the eternall Son of God, it is of infinite value above all the Soules, and above all the Sinnes of the Sonnes of men; it is an Universall Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is Generall and Universall for the promise and offer of it; upon the all-sufficiencie, and merit of Christs Death is grounded an universall promise of Salvation,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.25.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which, all that believe in him do actually receive
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:205094:142"/>remission of sins, and life everlasting; the promise of Life in Christs Death is universall to <hi>all men;</hi> the Gospel is to be preached to <hi>every creature,</hi> so that there is no man living that may not lay hold on that offer, no man is forbidden to come in, and take of the water of Life freely, that has a mind to it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17. <hi>Whosoever will, let him come and drink of the water of life freely:</hi> You cannot wish a larger Promise, nor an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sier Condition <hi>Whosoever will let him come;</hi> there is none excluded, but such as will not come in, nor acknowledge him, nor deny themselves, and their own Righteousness, their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Reason, &amp; sweet Contentments for his sake. Why then do men cavil at the doctrin of Redemption, as if it were not large enough? Is it too straight and narrow to take in <hi>Episcopius,</hi> or <hi>Corvinus,</hi> or any of the Arminian Subscribers? No, Do they know any man in the world, to whom the offer of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation may not be freely and truly made? No, not one, (the finally impenitent, and wilful contemners of Christ only excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) Whose cause then do they so hotly plead? Let every one that is athirst, come; let every one that is griev'd with sin, come; let every one that longs for Salvation, come, and he shall find rest to his soul he shall find Christ to be his God, &amp; his mighty Redeemer; he shall feel the vertue &amp; efficacy of Christs death.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Redemption is Generall or Universall, in respect of the Means,<note place="margin">Acts 17.30. 1 Tim. 2.4.</note> sincerely calling all men unto fellowship with Christ, and of Gods Grace in him (namely) the Word and Sacraments. The manner of Administration of this Grace in the Death of Christ is universall and compleat; so that if there were a thousand worlds more to be saved, they needed no other Gospel, no other Sacraments, no other Means to convert them, no new Law to make them partakers of Remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of sins by the Death of Christ; &amp; these are seen &amp; known of all men, easie to be understood, preach'd, and publish'd, not in a corner, but on the house top, to all nations; <hi>their sound is gone forth into all Lands,</hi> our Commission is, <hi>Go into all the world, preach the Gospel to every creature:</hi> Mar. 16.16. <hi>It is the power of God to salvation, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile,</hi> Rom 1 16. and it is also reall and sincere, for in the Gospel there is nothing false or dissembled: Whatsoever
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:205094:143"/>is offered or promised to men, the same shall be made good to them by God the Author of the Gospel; we offer Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all that will receive it, and it is sealed unto them by the Sacraments, and it shall be made good unto all them that receive it in Truth; we doe not promise mercy and life to any that continue in their sins, that stand off from Christ; but to as many as receive him, they shall be the Sons of God; And our word is true, it shall be made good unto you; the Lord saith not in vain to any man, <hi>Come unto me and I will ease you</hi> yea, so full and sufficient is this calling and preaching of Life by the Gospel, that they which hear it, and obey it not, are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> self condemned, they must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn themselves for their own obstinacy and contempt; if they be not converted by the means, they will be forced to confesse, Thou Lord wouldst have healed and gathered us, but we would not.</p>
                  <p>The Will of God touching Salvation, hath been so fully <hi>spoken unto them,</hi> that they <hi>have no excuse for their Sinne,</hi> John 15.22.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see, how Redemption, by Christs Death, is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal (namely) first, in respect of the Price and Merit: Secondly, of the Promise and Offer of it to all: Thirdly, in respect of the Means, by which men are brought to Faith; and therefore that Inference is unsound, which saith, that by our Doctrine we take away the True Gospel, and introduce a False, which affords no ground to believe; Ground enough you see, if you have hearts to accept of Christ upon true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel-terms.</p>
                  <p>Yet according to the second Branch of our distinction,<note n="2" place="margin">Branch.</note> we teach, that Christs Death is not effectuall to all; the fruit and benefit thereof is not received by all.</p>
                  <p>First, For God has not tied himself by any Promise in the New Testament, to communicate that Grace to all: Many people never <hi>heard</hi> of the name of Christ; and of them that have heard, <hi>all</hi> do not <hi>believe;</hi> Rom. 10.16. <hi>They have not all obeyed the Gospell; for</hi> Isaiah <hi>saith, Who hath believed our report?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God hath not tied himself to give Faith to all that
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:205094:143"/>hear it, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.24. <hi>Some believed the things that were spoken, &amp; some believed not; according to the Prophesie of</hi> Isaiah,<note place="margin">Acts 13.41.</note>
                     <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Hearing, ye shall heare, and not understand. Behold ye despisers, and wonder, and perish; for I work a work in your daies, which you shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.</hi> This Benefit is not effectually applied to any but to those whom the Father draweth, and hath given unto Christ to be fitted for glory; Christ so died (for all) that all which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve shall have remission of sins, and be justified from all things; from which they could never be justified by any thing that they could do or suffer. But in his Death, he so properly intended the good of Gods Elect that they should in due time be made partakers of the Benefits purchased, Christ being made theirs, and they his, as now I am to shew in our second Position, which in opposition to the second Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, I thus lay down (namely)</p>
                  <p>That God the Father, in giving his Son, and Christ, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Position. </seg>2</label> in dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Sinners, intended a special benefit to his Church; neither does it appear, that they intended that all, and every man should be saved by it, much lesse such as trust in lying vanities, and draw back to perdition: the Scripture-terms are very significant to this purpose, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.26. <hi>Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that he might present it to himself a glorious Church:</hi> So <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. He is said to <hi>pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase the Church with his own Blood;</hi> Again, <hi>John</hi> 15.13. <hi>I lay downe my life for my Friends,</hi> and <hi>for my Sheep,</hi> John 10.15.</p>
                  <p>Hereof there are two evident proofs: First, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>1</label> The event it self; Gods counsels and intentions have a certain fulfilling (what he decreed and purposed must stand) and therefore he intended not to redeem all, because all are not redeem'd; those whom God doth not pardon in time, he did not decree before time to pardon them;<note place="margin">Psal. 115.</note>
                     <hi>The Lord doth whatsoever he will in heaven and earth;</hi> and because he doth not save <hi>Judas,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he willed it not: <hi>An quod vult, non potest omnipotens? Vel (quod absit) velit salvare omnes homines, &amp; non potuit? Quid ergo restat, nisi ut ille, qui omnia quaecunque voluit, fecit; ideo hoc non faciat, quia nolit, non quia non possit: quia sicut
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:205094:144"/>verè omnia quae voluit,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Usher</hi> Hist. <hi>Gotteschalci</hi> pag. 30.</note>
                     <hi>fecit, ita verè noluit, quae non fecit;</hi> as <hi>Remigius</hi> Arch bishop of <hi>Lions,</hi> in his defence of <hi>Gotteschal,</hi> doth notably argue. God doth all things, that he will, and what he doth not, he willeth not.</p>
                  <p>A second evident proof (that Christ, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>2</label> in dying, intended a special benefit to his Church) is taken from his office of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession, whereby the merit of his Death is effectually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to our actuall Reconciliation: The grace of Redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on purchased for the Church, is not barely conditionall, if men will fulfill the conditions of the New Covenant, but for the merit and intercession of Christ, there is bestowed on them the spirit of Regeneration, Faith, and Perseverance, whereby they shall effectually obtain the benefits purchased (namely) Remission of sins,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> and Life everlasting.</p>
                  <p>The third Reason: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>3</label> The New Covenant is established in the Blood of Christ, and it doth contain two chief Blessings or Promises (namely) free pardon of Sin, and the writing of his Laws in our hearts, that is, the conditions of the New Covenant, which God requires of us; <hi>He</hi> promiseth to <hi>write them in our hearts;</hi> He doth not leave it to our fraile wills, whether we will perform them or no; but he gives the Ability, and the Graces themselves, whereby we shall infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly be led on unto Salvation; and for this purpose, Christ did not onely die for us, but rose again, &amp; sits at the right hand of God, making intercession for us. Joh. 17.9. <hi>I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine:</hi> &amp; again v. 24. <hi>Father I will, that they also whom thou hast given me, be with me, where I am:</hi> And so S. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth, Acts 5.31. that <hi>God hath exalted Christ with his own right hand, to be a Prince and Saviour, to give repentance to</hi> Israel <hi>and remis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Sins.</hi> Christ doth not onely provide a price for our souls,<note place="margin">Eph 4.10.</note> but <hi>gives gifts unto men,</hi> he draws all hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and <hi>being made Hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of the Church (which is his Body) he filleth all in all,</hi> Eph. 1.22. that so his Death, which is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for all, may be effectually applied to the Justification and Reconciliation of the Elect.</p>
                  <p>The Arminians absurdly divide between the impetration or obtaining of Remission of sins for all, and the Application thereof to all.</p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:205094:144"/>
                  <p>First, They teach, that Christ, by the merit of his Death, hath procured that God without injury to his justice, may enter into a new Covenant of Grace with mankind upon what conditions he pleaseth, and so hath opened a door of mercy to all men, that if they perform those conditions, they may be saved: but as for the actuall Application and Remission of sinnes, that he hath not procured for any man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, also, That Christ, by his Death, hath made God <hi>placabilem,</hi> but not <hi>placatum,</hi> that is, procured a freedom, that God may be reconciled if he will, and if other conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concur, but not an actual Reconciliation: Thus whilst they seem to advance and extend the comfort of Christs Death, they debase the Efficacy of it, and divide his Death from his Resurrection and Intercession, as if he were not an Intercessor for all those, for whom he is a Reconciler, and for whom he is said to have died.</p>
                  <p>Contrary hereunto we teach, that the Impetration, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of pardon for us by his Death, and the Application thereof are not divided, they be of equall extent; as many as Christ died for, for them also he rose again, and makes inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession for the effectuall obtaining of the fruit of his Merits: According to that notable Gradation of the Apostle,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32, 34.</note> He that spared not his own Son, how shall he not with him give us all things? It is Christ that died, yea, that is risen again, who is at the right hand of God, and maketh intercession for us; they say, Christs Death hath its end, though none hath bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit by it; but Christ hath then, &amp; not till then, attained the end of his death, when he hath actually brought them into a state of Grace and Glory, according to that of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. and <hi>John</hi> 10.15. <hi>I lay down my life for my sheep;</hi> mark what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, ver. 28. <hi>And I give unto them eternall life, and they shall never perish:</hi> with John 14.13. <hi>I go to prepare a place for you; I will come again and receive you unto my selfe, that where I am ye may be there also:</hi> Christ is the Mediatour between God and Man; in respect of God a full satisfaction to the divine Justice is given and taken; Gods wrath for the sins of the Elect is suffered and overcome; he rests contented
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:205094:145"/>and appeased, the Debt-book is crossed, and the Hand-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting cancelled; and Christ is justified in the Spirit from all our sins. And as unto us, Christ hath an intention to save all those for whom he shed his blood, and for that purpose he ever liveth to make intercession for them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. Thus you see how Christ in dying, intended the good of his Church, as appears partly by the event it self, partly by the course that he took for the effectual application thereof to his Elect.</p>
                  <p>From whence also we may inferre, as to the main question, that Christ did not die for all men,<note place="margin">John 17.9.</note> because he doth not <hi>pray</hi> for <hi>all the world;</hi> for whom he died, for them he makes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession: on the contrary, for whom he praies not, for them he died not; the same persons are redeemed and prayed for; <hi>There is one Mediatour of all, who gave himselfe a ransome for all,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.5, 6.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have endeavoured to make good my two Positions against the two forementioned Errors; it remains, that I clear some Objections.</p>

The sanctification externall to the purifying of the Flesh, consisteth in the Mans separation from the World, and dedication unto Gods Service by Calling and Covenant, common to all the Members of the visible Church, and it is forcible thus far, as to bring a man into estimation for a Saint before men, and unto the common Priviledges of the Church: Whereupon as men, so God also speaketh unto him, and of him, as one of his people, and dealeth with him in his externall dispensations, as with one of his own people; in this sense all the Congregation of <hi>Israel,</hi> and every one of them is called <hi>holy,</hi> Numb. 16.3.</p>
                  <p>The Sanctification internall, by Renovation, consisteth in a mans separation from the state of Nature to the state of Grace, from his old condition, to be a new creature indeed.

                     <hi>The sin of</hi> Adam <hi>was the sin of all the world; Christ took the sin and fault of the first</hi> Adam <hi>upon him, and therefore the sin of the World of Man, whose Nature was in</hi> Adam; <hi>and taking the sin upon himself, he withall takes the curse and condemnation of the whole upon him, to recover man out of his undone condition: And this is the ground of that Assertion of the Arminians (namely) that God will punish no man whatsoever for the onely sin of</hi> Adam: <hi>Christ did take away Originall guilt from all mankind, and so none are condemned or reprobated, but for Actuall sins:</hi> Thus the Author of <hi>Gods love to Mankind;</hi>

                     <hi>I will put enmity between thee and the woman, between thy seed and her seed.</hi> The <hi>Seed of the Servent</hi> without doubt, are the Generation of the Wicked; the <hi>Seed of the Woman</hi> is first <hi>Christ,</hi> then all that be his; between whom, and the Brood of the Serpent,<note place="margin">Heb. 2.13.

                  <p>Secondly note, that here Christ is promised to the Woman and her seed, not to the Serpent and his seed: Here is a Seed which shall overcome; and they are first, Christ, for <hi>he hath destroyed him that had the power of death,</hi> that is, the Devil; And secondly, Christians, who resisting the Devil stedfastly in Faith, <hi>The God of peace bruiseth Sathan under their feet;</hi> and here is also a seed to be conquered, and that is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and his Brood; to the one Christ is given a Redeemer, and Deliverer, to the other he is appointed for their over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw: Christ you see was not intended for all the seed of <hi>Adam.</hi>

                     <hi>they which are called might receive the promise of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall inheritance.</hi> Christs Death was the means to redeem Transgressions, but this is limited to them, whom God is pleased to call: And so <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see, that God can redeem the transgressions of the first Covenant by Christ, in the name, and on the behalf of a part of the seed of <hi>Adam,</hi> and condemn the same upon the residue, the seed of the Serpent.</p>

Ver. 47. <hi>The first man is of the earth, earthy; Adam</hi> was an Earthy man, made of the Earth, fed by the Earth, in his Constitution mortall, apt to return to the Earth, and by reason of Sin, subject to a necessity of dying.

Christ</hi> the second <hi>Adam,</hi> is <hi>the Lord from Heaven;</hi> the Lord from Heaven took our Nature, because his body was formed by the holy Ghost, and united to the Divine Person, and in this respect his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration was divine and heavenly. And so they that be Christ's are called <hi>heavenly men,</hi> their names are written in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and at the Resurrection they shall be conformed to that <hi>heavenly man,</hi> they shall be heavenly men too, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their bodies made spiritual, immortall, incorruptible, as now Christ, after his Resurrection, hath; for so it follows v. 49. <hi>As we have born the image of the earthy in this mortal condition: so at the Resurrection we shall bear the image of the heavenly in glory, and incorruption;</hi> and hereof he brings this proof, v. 50.

                     <hi>Now this I say Brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God:</hi> By flesh and blood in this place, he doth not mean carnall men, such as walk after the flesh (though it be true, that such persons shall never enter into Heaven) but rather this, such flesh and blood as ours is now, maintained by corporall meats and drinks of a mortall and corruptible Nature, cannot inherit the Kingdome of God; for so it followeth, <hi>Neither doth corruption inherit incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption,</hi> and <hi>all must be changed</hi> or <hi>die,</hi> that so <hi>this corruptible may put on incorruption, and this mortall put on immortality:</hi> This is the plain meaning of the Apostle in this place, and it shews that <hi>Adam</hi> and Christ in their severall Conditions, Qualifications, and States, were common Persons, and are the Patterns to which those, whom they represented, are conformed; and because the wicked are not represented by Christ, therefore their rising is not sanctified nor blessed by Christs rising. And it gives us reason to conclude, that God is able to put such a worth into the sufferings of Christ, that it is able to satisfie the law of transgressions for all, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuall to save all that come unto God by him, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn sin in others, even the sin of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as their Actuall sins, and yet not punish the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> twice, (namely) upon Christ, and the Sinner too; the Lord knows how to save the Seed of the Woman, and to reserve the Seed of the Serpent to be bruised and punished.</p>

                  <p>This Doctrine doth afford us a sufficient ground of prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Gospel to every creature, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋse </seg>2</label> and of praying for all men: Consider these clear truths by me now delivered, (namely)</p>
                  <p>First, That Christ, according to his Fathers will and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, hath paid a sufficient price to save all that believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent▪
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:205094:150"/>and if all believe, they may be saved, yea, they shall be saved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the Sacrifice of Christ doth really sanctifie all those for whom it was offered, because all they,<note place="margin">Iohn 17.19. Heb 9.13, 14.</note> for whom Christ gave himself, them also he doth sanctifie, and save to the uttermost, <hi>Non merendo tantùm &amp; materiam reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis procurando, sed etiam efficaciter salutem operando &amp; ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicando,</hi> that is, not onely by meriting their Reconciliation, but also really applying and bestowing the same, else he should not be a perfect Saviour unto them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Christ hath actually reconciled to God, by his blood all such, and none but such, as believe, the impenitent are not redeemed, he hath not obtained mercy and peace for them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Christ came not into the world to condemn it, but to save it, for all the world is either Believers, or Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; he that believeth on him is not condemned: As for the Unbelievers, they are condemned already, being under the Law; their farther Condemnation and Aggravation of their rebellion against, God, is, <hi>per accidens,</hi> through their own maliciousnesse, not through the blessed Word which they hear.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, All men that hear, are bound to believe and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Gospel, and Christ therein offered, and to repent of their sins; the which if they refuse to do, if they will not come in, they justly perish.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Christs Death is the foundation of all our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which actually we receive for pardon and purchase (as of our Vocation, Justification) and it has not attained its end, untill he have brought many Sons to glory: for he hath satisfied for every evil, and merited every good thing for us, there is no Sin or Sinner above his Merits and Mercy.</p>
                  <p>These precious Truths contained in our Doctrine, are a suffic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent ground of preaching the Gospel to every creature; and they afford us a visible ground, upon which the beloved of God, every humble soul, might accept of peace, and so come to have faith and hope in God: and likewise a visible
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:205094:151"/>rule of rejecting all, who wilfully contemn their own peace, or refuse to return, and judge themselves unworthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Life.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Here is also a sufficient warrant of praying for all men; there is no man living but may be saved, for ought we know; there is merit enough in Christ, and spirit enough in Christ, and Grace enough in the Gospel; they which are dead may live. He that believeth is already passed from death to life; and he that believeth not as yet, may be a child of God, we helping forward their Conversion by our Prayers, we cannot know any man: No man can know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be a Reprobate; there is hope of Forgiveness, so long as there is possibility of Repentance: St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires <hi>Prayers to be made for all men,</hi> because <hi>God will have all to be saved,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.1, 4. And S. <hi>Paul</hi> himself prayed; <hi>My hearts desire and prayer for</hi> Israel <hi>is, that they may be saved;</hi> we sin not in praying so, though many be not saved, because there is ground for it in Gods revealed Will, concurring with the universall merit of Christ, and the generall offer of salvation by the Gospel.</p>

                  <p>In the mean while, methinks an Arminian can hardly bear a part with the redeemed ones, fully and heartily in that tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant song of thansgiving to the Lamb, when he shall, as a Sheepherd, or as a Bridegroom, bring all his blessed train

               </p>
               <p>To the former question I shall speak but briefly, as being but preparatory to the other.</p>

Arminians teach, that Grace sufficient unto Conversion, is given to all, even to some that are never actually converted, and accordingly they distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish between Grace <hi>sufficient</hi> and <hi>effectuall:</hi> Sufficient Grace, say they, is of great force to the conversion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet not alwaies effectuall by reason of our fault. But it is then effectuall, <hi>cum novam illi contumaciam &amp; rebellionem homo non opponit, quam exse opponere potuisset.</hi> And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, speaking of resisting Gods Grace, they say, that a man may carry himself in such sort against God by evil actions, <hi>ut iis pofitis Dei gratia ipsum actu non convertat, etiam tunc, cum ipsum conversum serio vult, &amp; convertere aggressus fuit.</hi> Hence I thus argue, That Grace is not sufficient to Salvation, which meeting with a dead heart, and obstinate will, doth leave the sinner unconverted, even then when God intended to convert him, and doth most seriously endeavour it. But
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:205094:152"/>according to their Doctrine, the most saving Grace of God being applied to the conversion of a Sinner, meeting with an obstinate will, doth not actually convert him, no not though God intended it, and indeavour it; therefore Grace suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for Salvation is not given to all: It is naturall to us, and the greatest evil in our Nature, and that which doth most directly oppose the work of Grace, and hinder our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to be of a dead heart, that doth swinishly tread under foot the Son of God, and wilfully refuse to accept the Grace offered: And on the contrary; it is the great work of Grace to <hi>quicken</hi> the <hi>dead</hi> heart,<note place="margin">Eph. 2.1.

                  <p>First, <hi>That the Gospel is the Ministery of life, not in it self only, but in respect of mens power to believe it, when it is preached or declared unto them: For, say they, men are not blinde for want of Eyes, but for want of Light; and when Light or Truth is discovered to them, they have faculties suitable, fit, and apt to receive it: And if God should deprive men of all ability, and power to repent, and believe and turn to him, and then should still be moving and perswading them, urging and pressing them to believe and turn to him, even those that perish, as well as those that are saved; this would seem somewhat harder than injustice it self; As if a King having caused a mans legs to be cut off, though in a way of justice, should perswade this man to run a race.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The rest of this Chapter is spent in burdening the contrary opinion with grosse absurdities, which I will remove in their due place.</p>
                  <p>The second Error is this,<note place="margin">Lond. Test. pag. 14.</note>
                     <hi>Naturall men may do such things as whereunto God hath by way of promise annexed Grace, and acceptation as unto Believing; and if it be possible, that they may believe, then they may do such things whereunto God hath by way of promise annexed Grace and Acceptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Faith hath the promise of acceptation annexed to it, no man ever doubted; and that natural men may be brought to believe, is as unquestionable: But of the manner how Faith is wrought in the heart, and what influence Free will doth contribute thereunto, will be handled in consutation of

                  <p>First, God doth enlighten the Mind with the light of his Word and Spirit; the which, when it is clearly presented to the Understanding, it cannot resist that light, but it is bound up to assent unto the Object so proposed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God doth bow and incline the Will to the act of Faith and Obedience, so far forth, as that the Will not onely can, but also doth, obey, whensoever it doth obey, not of, or from, or by it self: We say, moreover, that there is given to the Will, a supernatural Power to believe by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate working of God upon it, provided, that that action of God do not necessitate the Will to consent, nor take away its liberty and power to dissent, or not to believe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God doth also correct our Affections, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing castigated, and ordered, the Will is made more prompt and ready to exercise the acts of Piety.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Huic suae conversioni homo obicem ponere potest, &amp; ponit saepe.

                  <p n="6">6. It is in the power of man to put a Bar to this his own Conversion, and he doth often hinder it; wherefore we say,
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:205094:157"/>that the Will is not necessitated to choose the good; but he can, and oft-times doth, resist and refuse it, yea, all those operations which God doth use to the conversion of a sinner, being put forth, yet conversion of the man does not alwaies follow: Mans conversion is contingent and uncertain, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause free.</p>

                  <p n="7">7. If a reason be demanded, Why this man is converted, not that man? We answer, This man is converted, because he not opposing a new Rebellion, and Contumacy, God doth convert him; the other is not converted, because he doth oppose a new perversenesse against the offer of Grace. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, you demand, Why this man is obstinate to rebell, and not the other? We answer, This man doth resist, because he will; the other doth not, because he is moved by God not to resist. If you demand, Whether he, which doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, and so is converted, hath a greater measure of Grace gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, than he which doth resist his own conversion? We answer, That the <hi>exciting</hi> and <hi>preventing</hi> Grace in both, is equall; but <hi>co operating</hi> Grace the one hath, not the other.</p>
                  <p>This is a great part of their Doctrine touching the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and liberty of mans Free-will in things spiritual, in which I note two things:</p>
                  <p>First, That it is evident, that all which they so largely speak of <hi>Grace</hi> (as if they meant to ascribe the <hi>beginning, progresse,</hi> and <hi>perfection</hi> of all good to the Grace of God) is but a mockery; for if it be in the Will to resist the same
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:205094:157"/>work of Grace, whereby another is converted, or to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the same Grace, which another rejected: if after all the labour which God doth use, or will bestow for the conversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the soule, the party may oppose and hinder it, if all that they ascribe to <hi>Grace</hi> be but to reveal the Doctrine of the Gospel for <hi>enlightning</hi> of the <hi>Minde,</hi> and to <hi>stir up</hi> the <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and to give power to the <hi>Will</hi> to <hi>believe,</hi> yet so as that notwithstanding that power, the Will is still <hi>in aequilibri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> whether she will turn to God, or not; I say, if after all that, they say, the Will must strike the stroak, and determine the matter; what is this, but to set up the power of <hi>Nature,</hi> and to diminish the work of <hi>Grace,</hi> to magnifie Man, and rob God of his Glory?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I observe also, how that in the Opinion, both of these old Arminians, and our new Adversaries, the <hi>Will,</hi> in its naturall state, is clogged with two Impediments (namely) <hi>want</hi> of <hi>Light</hi> revealed, and <hi>perversenesse</hi> of <hi>Affections,</hi> the which being removed by the Gospel, which brings Life and Immortality to light, then the Will is at liberty to exercise its innate and essentiall liberty (for it lost it not by the Fall) to act upon those supernaturall Objects either well or ill; a man in his naturall estate, being by them compared to a man in the dark, he wants not eyes, but light; Bring him a light and he sees again: Or as a man in Prison, knock off his bolts, and open the prison doors, and he is at liberty to go away: So, say they, it is in this businesse: But the contrary will be made appear in our Answer to our second Question, which now follows.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether the use of those means being granted,</hi>

                     <hi>it be in the power of mans Free-will to convert himselfe; to accept or refuse the Grace offered?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is denied.</p>
                  <p>This must be the state of the question, for so they declare themselves (namely) <q>That the Gospel is the Ministery of Life, not in it self onely, but in respect of mens power to believe it when it is preached or declared unto them:</q> This we deny; for God in the raising of a soul to life, doth not onely afford means, but he opens our understandings to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:205094:158"/>and causeth the heart to hearken. The Apostle had the Scriptures, they read the Prophesies concerning Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.25, 44. But one thing more was needfull to form a right Faith in them; And what was that? See ver. 45. <hi>Then opened he their understandings, that they might understand the Scriptures.</hi> 'Tis true of every naturall man, which S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the Jews, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.14. <hi>There is a vail upon the heart in reading the Scriptures, untill it be done away in Christ.</hi> Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes for the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> that God would give them a spirit of Wisdome and Revelation in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Christ,<note place="margin">Ephes. 1.18.</note>
                     <hi>that the eyes of your understanding being enlightned, ye may know.</hi> He writes to them that had the Gospel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched unto them already; but he knew that they wanted sight, as well as light, and therefore prayed that God would give them eyes to see and understand.</p>
                  <p>We that are Ministers can hold forth the Light; But there is a farther Ministery required, even the spirit of the living God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 3.3.</note> to write the Gospel, not <hi>in tables of stone,</hi> but <hi>in the flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tables of the heart.</hi> If it be written onely with ink, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tables of stone, if that were enough, then he would not speak of another writing by the spirit of God in the tables of the heart; But now he promiseth <hi>to write his laws in our hearts,</hi> &amp; therefore let us humbly beg, &amp; thankfully receive that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, &amp; not trust to our own strength. God doth not regenerate thy soul, that it may be able to know him, and yet not know him, or that it may be able to believe, &amp; yet not believe; or that it might be able to love him, and yet not love him; but he therefore makes thee able to know, to believe, and love, that thou maist indeed both know, believe, and love him; he worketh not onely <hi>posse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Phil. 2.13.</note> but <hi>velle; God worketh in you both to will, and to do, of his own good pleasure.</hi> We must <hi>work out our own salvation,</hi> that is, imploy all our abilities and indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to get Salvation, and that with all holy <hi>reverence, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility,</hi> and <hi>carefulnesse,</hi> ver. 12. but it is the Lords work to frame us to will and to do, and that not according to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, but of his good pleasure.</p>
                  <p>Now to help your understandings in this matter, and to prevent confusion in discourse, you must carefully distinguish,
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:205094:158"/>First, between the

                  <p>Secondly, again you must distinguish between the Will free from

                     </list> We acknowledge that Mans will is free from compulsion;<note place="margin">Of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Will.</note> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto Sin, or unto Vertue: There is no force or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, or outward necessity laid upon the Will; but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Bondage to Sin, <hi>under which</hi> all men are <hi>sold,</hi> Rom. 7.14. so the Will is in bondage, till <hi>Christ</hi> do make it <hi>free,</hi> Rom. 6.17, 20. It acts freely, but not graciously, till it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by Grace; and then so far as it is regenerate, it willeth things that are good: The Will of a natural Man in its grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Bondage is free from Compulsion, and Constraint, and in its greatest Liberty it is in bondage under Sin.</p>

                     <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Anabaptists, as if we did make man a stock, or a stone; as if God did convert him whether he would or not; as if God, by his Predestination and Decrees, did compell and lay a necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty upon men to sin, or as if men were unjustly blamed, exhorted, reproved, for not believing, for not doing their duty, if they have not Free-will,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>We answer: First, every mans will is free, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>1</label> whatsoever it doth, it doth freely: when wicked men sin, rebell against the Light, resist the Truth, they do it freely; when godly men embrace Christ, when they forsake the waies of Death, they do it freely, for else it were not a Will; the outward man may be forced, as in a storm, to cast the wares into the Sea; in a danger, to deliver up one's money to save the life. And this we do, after a sort, freely, because of two evils,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:205094:159"/>we choose the lesse; the Will is a naturall faculty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free to his own actions, which are in its reach and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> we teach, that the Will is still free from compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or constraint; wicked men are not forced to Sin, nor good men to come to Christ; they desire him, they prize him above every thing that can be set against him. But we confesse,<note place="margin">John 8.24, 36.</note> that in respect of the bondage of Sin, it is a corrupt Free-will: All men, by Nature, are servants of Sin, and so continue till <hi>Christ make them ree:</hi> Man by the Fall is spoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, not of his will, but of the soundnesse of his will; they will freely, but not well, and therefore that good-will, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we embrace Christ, and the things of the Spirit, is not a naturall faculty born with us into the World, but renued in us by the spirit of Grace and Regeneration; and all the Saints, so far as they are regenerate, they have a good, and an holy will, made alive unto God, <hi>even when we were dead in sins and trespasses, he hath quickned us together with Christ,</hi> and then <hi>we yeild our selves unto God, as they that are alive from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the question is,<note n="2" place="margin">The strength of the Will.</note> of the strength and power of an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate mans will, as to his first uprising from the state of Sin and Death; whether it have any power to convert it self, to raise it self to spirituall actions, to do any thing towards its own justification; or whether there be in the Will before Regeneration, <hi>vis activa,</hi> an active force to believe, and raise it selfe by the onely help of exciting and preventing Grace?</p>
                  <p>This is denied in Scripture; and mans weaknesse, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency to help himself, acknowledged, because we are dead in Sins and Trespasses, enemies to God in our mindes, and <hi>without strength:</hi> And what spirituall good can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from such blind, carnall soules, till the spirit of God come and renue them? When the spirit of Grace first takes hold of us, it findes us in <hi>our Blood,</hi> and saies unto us, <hi>live:</hi> it findes us in a dead sleep, and therefore it saith, <hi>Awake thou that fleepest, stand up from the Dead, and Christ shall give thee light.</hi>

                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:205094:159"/>
                  <p>There is in all a power to will, but to will well, that is of renuing Grace.</p>
                  <p>Amongst many Reasons, I shall content my self with these three:</p>
                  <p>The first is taken from the nature of Regeneration, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>1</label> which is the work of the Spirit, making a new Creature, restoring spirituall life of Grace to the soule, that was spiritually dead in Sins and Trespasses: Thus the Scripture speaks of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; <hi>The Sons of God</hi> (saith St. <hi>John</hi>) John 1.13. <hi>are born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Note two things; First, that Gods Children must be born again; a child of Nature, as long as he is such, is not the child of God: Secondly, in this new Birth, the will of Man, and of the Flesh, is expresly excluded, and Gods power alone set up: Now if the first act of our u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>From this quickning Grace is our first awakening and rising from sin; <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of Truth,</hi> Ja. 1.18. The Instrument is the <hi>Word,</hi> the Author and Efficient is the <hi>Will of God,</hi> not the will of him that is begotten; for the same thing is not the Parent and the Child, nothing can beget it self; we are they that are begotten, and born, and God is our Father that begat us; <hi>He hath made us,</hi>

                     <hi>and not we our selves.</hi> As we cannot make our selves, so neither can we regenerate our selves; therefore the Apostle saies, <hi>we are</hi> not our own, but <hi>his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:205094:160"/>good works.</hi> See that place, it is very full to our purpose; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. <hi>By grace ye are saved through faith, and that not of your selves,</hi> (not of any active power in your wills, <hi>ad actus spirituales eliciendos) it is the gift of God;</hi> why should he so expresly say, not of our selves, if our selves did so much as our Adversaries affirm? The Apostle goes on with another (Not) <hi>not of works, lest any man should boast,</hi> (all is of Grace) <hi>for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works;</hi> we must first be created in Christ, ere we can do works of the spirituall Life; he worketh in us new Wills, and new Hearts, whereby we believe unto Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I demand, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>2</label> whether these spirituall actions of Faith, Love, and Obedience, do arise from a naturall, or from a spirituall Root and Seed?<note place="margin">John 3.6.</note> Not from a naturall; for <hi>that which is born of the Flesh, is Flesh;</hi> Every Tree brings fruit according to its kind; and if not from a naturall Root, then not from the will of an unregenerate person: Nay, not from the will at all by the Arminians Doctrine; for they hold, that the Will was never endued at first with spirituall qualities and gifts, and therefore by the Fall, it could not lose them; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in Mans Regeneration, they say, that spirituall Gifts are not infused, or planted in the Will; onely at the first God planted that naturall Freedom in the Will, <hi>ad volendum vel malum, vel bonum;</hi> which by the Fall, was clogged and hindred from acting by the blindnesse of the Minde, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versenesse of the Affections; the which Impediments being removed by preventing Grace, the Will can, and doth, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise its native Freedome, of willing, or nilling Good and Evil: Now hence I infer, that if the Understanding and the Affections be the onely subject of Regeneration, and that the Will, <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> as it is a naturall Faculty, without any spiritual Qualities sea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, Well then it remaines, that spirituall Fruit must
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:205094:160"/>spring from a spirituall Root, or Seed; And what is that?<note place="margin">Spirituall Fruit springs from a spiritual Root.</note> You shall see in three places of Scripture, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.1. <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth is born of God;</hi> and so 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7. <hi>Every one that loveth is born of God;</hi> with <hi>John</hi> 15.5. <hi>As the branch can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not beare fruit except it abide in the vine, no more can ye, except ye abide in me; for without me,</hi> as your Root, <hi>you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Now consider, Which of these is the first, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to love, and to bear fruit, or to be born of God? and to be in Christ the Root? Surely, to be born of God, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore believing and loving for we therefore <hi>believe</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> because (sayes the Text) we are <hi>born of God,</hi> and have <hi>his seed</hi> in us; and we therefore bear fruits of Grace and Piety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we are in Christ the Root; <hi>Thou bearest not the Root, but the Root thee.</hi> Hence I conclude, that although there be no discernable distance of time between Gods Act begetting us to the Faith, and our Act of turning to God, yet in order of working, and causality, the work of God must needs be first to heale, to change, to rectifie, and make obedient our crooked wills, to take away that inbred repugnancy,<note place="margin">Rom. 8 7.</note> which is in our wills against the will of God, before we can obey the Call of Christ; <hi>Non ideo currit rota, ut rotunda sit, sed quia rotunda est:</hi> In order of working; first, Grace gives Life and Qualities to the dead Will; and then being renued, it wills the conversion, and becomes a voluntary Instrument of God to apprehend his Grace offered, and to work forward with it; but, as I said, this it doth, not by its own naturall strength, but by vertue of the seed of Grace, and new Life that God hath put into it; first make the <hi>Tree</hi> good, and then his <hi>Fruit</hi> good.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see how the Grace of God doth first turn us, and then we are turned; there is first a seed of God in us, which because it liveth and abideth in us, therefore we believe in him, and love him; and this Seed or Root is the first Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of all our spirituall life, and the good that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes thereupon: Let God have the glory of his owne Grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and lastly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>3</label> If such a power of mans will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; S. <hi>Paul</hi> questions 1 Cor. 4.7. <hi>Who maketh thee
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:205094:161"/>to differ from another? And what hast thou that thou didst not receive?</hi> will easily be answered, but in a sense quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his minde: for this opinion of Free-will being true, I may answer, I have made my selfe to differ by doing that which was in my power to do, which another would not do, though it were as well in his power, as in mine; for I and they were alike partakers of Exciting Grace; and God was as ready to receive them to mercy, as my self, if they would believe and repent; but they, by the liberty of their wills, did refuse that Grace, and remain unconverted; and I, by the same liberty of my will, did embrace it, and so am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and brought into a state of Grace. And so to the other Question; <hi>What hast thou, that thou didst not receive?</hi> I may answer, I have determined mine owne Will to the first Act of believing; which power I received from no Grace of God, but had it by Nature in mine owne Will.</p>
                  <p>How inconsistent are these things with the Doctrine of Gods Grace? and how abhorrent to the hearts of Christians, who, by experience, have felt the work of Grace upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? I sometimes wonder, how it comes to passe that the Patrons of Free-will, so few of them do give evidence that they are gracious men; moralized civill men they be; but I feare me, many of them are strangers to the power of Grace; they speak little experimentally of Regeneration, and the work of Grace in the soule: Either let them use their Free-will better, or if they cannot, let them not say and hold, that men can;<note place="margin">Rev. 3.18. John 6.44. 2 Corin. 3.5.</note> but let them flie to God for his <hi>Grace</hi> to <hi>heale</hi> them, to his <hi>Spirit</hi> to <hi>draw</hi> them, to his <hi>Power</hi> to make them <hi>sufficient.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you see what is to be thought; First, of the freedome of mans Will; Secondly, of its Strength and Power, which is proved to be in none <hi>(for being servants of Sin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 6.20.</note>
                     <hi>we are free from Righteousnesse.)</hi> First, because we are born, not of the will of Man, but of God: Secondly, because the naturall will cannot be the Seed and Root of spirituall qualities; Thirdly, because it is not in man to make himselfe to differ from another.</p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:205094:161"/>
                  <p>I conclude this point with those savoury and wholsome words of the tenth Article of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Artic. 39.</note>
                     <hi>The condition of Man, after the Fall of</hi> Adam, <hi>is such, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not turn and prepare himself by his own naturall strength, and good works, to Faith, and calling upon God; wherefore we have no power to doe good works, pleasant and acceptable to God, without the Grace of God preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us, when we have that good will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against this Doctrine, sundry things are objected; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> I will instance onely in two or three particulars. Against the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Will, which we grant; it is objected, That <hi>that is not the true nature of Freedome, to act freely, and without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion: But true freedome of will</hi> (say they) <hi>stands in indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency between two Objects, whereby it can bend it self equally to good or evill, to accept or refuse the offer of Grace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (say they) <hi>if God do determine the Will in our Conversion, its Liberty is violated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer four things:</p>
                  <p>First, Why should it seem a strange thing, that God, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> which made our Wills, should move and rule in them without doing violence to their Nature?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is best with us when God determines our wills, for then we be sure ever to choose the thing that is good; for God inclines them onely unto good, unto evill we can determine them fast enough of our selves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The true nature of Free-will, does not consist in an indifferency unto contrary things, as unto Good and Evil, for by their own confession, in our lapsed estate, the Will acts freely in evil, but it has not a liberty and power to will spirituall good, as well as evil; and they give the reason, because in this state the Minde is void of the knowledge of spirituall good, and therefore the Will cannot desire it:<note place="margin">Script. Remon. pag. 7.</note> And again, in Heaven the Will has not liberty of indifferency to choose evil as well as good, and the reason is, because in that state of perfection, the mind shall be filled with the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp; delight it self only in that which is holy &amp; good, &amp; yet in both these states (namely) of Unregeneracy, and Glory, they
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:205094:162"/>do with us acknowledge, that the Will is free: Wherein then stands the true nature of liberty, if not in such an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency?</p>
                  <p>I answer, in the free choice of our Will, arising from the judgement of our own understandings; this or that I judge to be good or evil; and accordingly I freely choose or forsake it: wheresoever these two concur (namely) first freedome from Violence and Necessity, and secondly, the full con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of our own reason; There is the whole and true nature of Liberty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, God, in converting us, does not take away the liberty of Will, but its obstinacy; <hi>Haec gratia à nullo duro corde respuitur, ideo enim tribuitur, ut cordis duritia primitus auferatur.</hi> And why should they contend for such a liberty of Will, as a part of its perfection and excellency, which is indeed its greatest weaknesse, wickednesse, and shame, (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) to be able to resist the grace of God intending our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version. O that I had no bitter root in my will of rebelling against the will of God! Lord let there never be but one will between me and thee; though I faile in many things, yet let not my will be false; Let me ever be able, with comfort, to say with the Apostle, <hi>The evill which I doe, I allow not; and if I do that I would not, it is no more I that do it but sinne that dwelleth in me</hi> (Rom. 7.15.20.) S. <hi>Paul</hi> bewailes the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of his heart, he disclaimes all its lustings, <hi>It is not I,</hi> Who is it then? Is it not a part of thy wills liberty to <hi>war against the Law of God?</hi> Yes, of a base corrupt will; for it is Sin in me;<note place="margin">Ver. 17.20.</note> call it what you will, it is Sin, it is <hi>Sin</hi> that <hi>dwelleth in me:</hi> O that I were delivered from that Liberty; it is Sin, it is a wretched Liberty, O then let not vaine man glory in his shame; Let us bewaile not onely our own evil wills, but even the pronenesse that is in us to will any thing against God.</p>
                  <p>Against the weaknesse and impotencie of our wills, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>2</label> it is objected as above, <hi>If God should deprive men of all ability and power to believe, and yet be still moving and pressing them to believe, this would seem barder than injustice it selfe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>yea; this would represent the glorious God in his greatest expressions
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:205094:162"/>of mercy, grace, and love to the world, rather as laughing the world to scorn in that great misery wherein it is plunged than as a God any way truly desirous, or intending to relieve it.</hi> Lond. T. pag. 11.</p>
                  <p>I answer three things. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p>First To fasten inferences upon God, is a dangerous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption; take heed of it, lest ye be found to charge God foolishly, <hi>Will you speak wickedly for God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 13.7. Said <hi>Job</hi> to his friends.</note>
                     <hi>and talk deceitfully for him,</hi> as defenders of his Honour? He needs it not; To salve his Justice, as you apprehend it, will you deny his Grace?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God doth not cut off any mans legs, and then bid him walk; <hi>God made man upright,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccl. 7.29.</note>
                     <hi>but he</hi> himself <hi>found out many inventions;</hi> the bondage of our will is not to be laid upon God, but upon <hi>Adams</hi> fall, which is the proper root, whence that impotency in our wills ariseth; The Creature is turned away from his Maker, May not the Lord call upon him to return, and pay his due obedience? Nay, is it not a mercy, that he seeks those that were lost? or did you not like his manner and course that he hath taken, to make offer of Grace to the lost world? Will you quarrel at it, because it is so generall? Perhaps more generall than are the wills of men to receive it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God doth endue men with principles and gifts of Reason, Judgement, Memory, Conscience, Understanding, by the use and improvement whereof, they are capable to be convinced of Sin, and of Christs readinesse and ability to save, also to give credit to the things they heare. Yea, more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, God doth work in the hearts of men, that live under the preaching of the Gospel, certain effects, whereby people are led on towards their conversion; such as are,<note place="margin">Acts 2.37. Hebr. 6.4. Luke 15.18. Luke 8.13.</note> knowledge of Gods Will, sense of Sin, feare of Wrath, belief of the Curse of the Law, consultations and purposes to seeke for Deliverance, and to forsake Sin; some joy and hopes upon possibility of Pardon.</p>
                  <p>By all which effects, they perceive that God doth call them to repentance and mercy, and accordingly are almost per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded to be Christians indeed. Yet through the subtilty of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:205094:163"/>the Devil, who <hi>stealeth</hi> away the <hi>good seed</hi> that was sowne; and the <hi>lusts</hi> of other things entring in, do <hi>choak</hi> the <hi>Word,</hi> so that they, that after all this, remain in their naturall &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full state; their own hearts tell them that they have dealt ungraciously with Gods Spirit, that they have striven against the Light, that they have not done what was in their power to do, yea, I am perswaded, that there is not any of those, who live under the Gospel, and are so pathetically moved and pressed to repent (as in the Objection is alledged) but they must confesse that they are damned, not because they could not believe and turn to God, but because they would not, because other things were loved above Christ, because they <hi>forsook</hi> their <hi>own mercy,</hi> and so are justly left to their own hearts lusts: The Godly themselves do know by experience, that they also have many times grieved the Spirit, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened against God, especially in the daies of their unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, and should have likewise perish'd, had not the Lord fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them with his Grace. The summe is, they that perish must ascribe the fault of their non conversion to themselves; &amp; they whose hearts God hath farther mollified, must ascribe the praise thereof unto his Grace. And why God doth follow the one with Grace, &amp; leave the other to his own hearts lusts, is a question that does belong to that mysterie, <hi>O the depth of the wisdome and knowledge of God</hi> (we cannot fathome it) <hi>How unsearchable are his judgements,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ro. 11.33, 35.</note>
                     <hi>and his waies past finding out! Who hath first given unto him, and it shall be recompenced again?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The rest of their Reasons against our Doctrine, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obj. </seg>3</label> are but complaints and frettings, as it were, against God; Ile name but one more: <hi>If Salvation be not to be had, but onely by Christ, through Faith, and that Condemnation comes on them through Ʋnbelief,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lond.</hi> T. p. 12.</note>
                     <hi>and yet God afforded them not power to believe; then the damnation of the most part of men, was an invincible effect of the Death of Christ, and their condition more desperate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered with those meanes than before, it being able to condemne them, but not bring them to Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A most absurd inference. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> For,</p>
                  <p>First, Mens Damnation is not the effect, nor the end
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:205094:163"/>of Christ's dying; his Death is the Life of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, What then? Is it a consequent of his Death? Neither so, for they had perished, though Christ had never died (namely) for transgressing the first Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, What then? Is Christs Death an occasion of the damnation of any man? Not so neither; for though we doubt not to say with the Scripture, that <hi>Christ is a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence to many,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.8.</note> yet he is not properly and simply an occasion of their perishing (for they were <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der condemnation</hi> already, <hi>John</hi> 3.18.) onely their unbelief leaves them under their former sad condition, with some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease to their condemnation, because they shew new obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, and more disobedience against God than others, that never saw the Light, as it there follows, ver. 19. <hi>This is the condemnation</hi> (the just and great condemnation) <hi>that light is come into the world, and men loved darknesse rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, Christs Death is not in it self an occasion of encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Condemnation, but meerely accidentally, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of mans Disobedience, as S. <hi>Peter</hi> expresly speaks;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2 7, 8.</note>
                     <hi>He is a stone of stumbling;</hi> To whom? <hi>To them that be disobedient,</hi> which stumble at the Word, being disobedient;<note place="margin">Rom. 7.8.</note> in himself he is altogether <hi>precious,</hi> and the <hi>Lord of life.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the Law, that <hi>Sin taking occasion by the Commandement, wrought in him all manner of Concupiscence;</hi> Did the Law work Concupiscence in <hi>Paul?</hi> No; but Sin, by the Law, did; Sin taking occasion by the Law, did; the like may be said in this case, Christ is holy, his Death a savour of Life; no mans ruine is the effect of Christs Death; What then? Through mens own disobedient hearts, that love Darknesse rather than Light, the justness and aggravation of their condemnation is manifested.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see with how little connexion, or shew of reason, mens Damnation is charged on Christs Death, whereas at the most it is but an occasion, an accidentall occasion, not in its own nature, but from mans own wretchednesse; an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion not of their rume, for they were undone before, and no mans unbelief does first put him under condemnation, but
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:205094:164"/>leaves him there under wrath) but of an higher degree of Condemnation, because they neglect so great Salvation, and tread the Son of God under foot.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>4</label>
                     <hi>Are not Threats, Exhortations, all in vaine?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This will be sufficient for you to remember, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> that all those invitations, exhortations, patient waitings, warnings, threats, &amp;c. which you meet with every where in Scripture, doe not shew what our power is to co-operate to our first up-rising from our sinfull state: But first, what the Creatures duty is to his Creatour; Secondly; what we can doe by Grace pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting and renuing us, not of our selves; Thirdly, what God intends to doe for his Elect by those meanes, for they are Gods power to Salvation, and God by calling on us doth cause the <hi>deafe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 5 25.</note> yea, the <hi>dead</hi> to <hi>heare the voice of the Son of God, and to live;</hi> by knocking he doth awaken them that are in a dead sleep; by calling, he causeth us to heare his voice and to returne: Now God shewes what he intends to do for us, because the Precepts, which require duty of us, are in other Places of Scripture turned into Promises. Thus he requires <hi>Israel</hi> to <hi>circumcise their heart,</hi> Deut. 10.16. <hi>c.</hi> 30.6. He promiseth, that <hi>he will do it for them.</hi> Thus he requires, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. <hi>Make ye a new heart; for why will ye die, O house of</hi> Israel? Cap. 36.26. He promiseth <hi>to give them a new heart, and a new spirit:</hi> Gods precepts shew our Duty, and when we see that he turns his Precepts into Promises, it minds us of his Mercy, and our own weaknesse; if the performance of the condition of the new Covenant were left to our owne power, it would not be unto us a Ministery of life and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; for we are no more able of our selves to believe, than to keep the Law, therefore he saith, <hi>This is the Covenant that I will make with the house of</hi> Israel <hi>after those daies, saith the Lord, I will put my lawes into their minde, and write them in their hearts,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 8.10. The conditions which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us, he worketh in us; God doth require us to <hi>repent,</hi> and he doth give <hi>repentance,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.26. He doth bid us <hi>come to Christ,</hi> and he <hi>drawes</hi> us unto <hi>Christ,</hi> John 6.66. If God should give us onely a possibility to believe and to turne unto him, and should leave the acting of it to our wills, we
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:205094:164"/>should even do as our first Parents did, depart from God, and never bring that possibility into act.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Such invitations, warnings, &amp;c. do shew what it is that we ought to beg at the throne of Grace, seeing we have not the sufficiency of our selves, namely, that he would work our works in us, that he would circumcise our hearts, and give us new hearts, &amp;c. and finally, that we ought to ascribe the whole glory of our Salvation to his rich and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable Grace.</p>
                  <p>By the former Distinctions and Doctrine,<note place="margin">Application.</note> the people are helped to discern Truth and Falshood, Good and Evil in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry cases: As for example,</p>
                  <p>If the Question in discourse be, <hi>Whether Gods Decree,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Answer is No; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> because God has decreed not onely the things themselves, which shall be, but also the manner how they shall be; Some things work naturally, some things proceed from necessary causes, which being put, the event al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies follows, as heat from fire; some things work volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, and the event comes to passe freely, because they depend on voluntary causes, as to build a Colledge, or Hospitall, and so of all humane actions; Some things happen contingently, and as it were by chance, in respect of us, because they have no known or constant cause, as walking in an Orchard, an Apple falls upon my head, my walking is not the cause that the Apple fell, nor the Apple of my walking there. Now God decreeing that voluntary Agents shall work freely, therefore his decree does not take away my freedome, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther establish it: The selling of <hi>Joseph</hi> into <hi>Egypt,</hi> God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed it, yet that thing was done freely and willingly by <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>'s Brethren; the reason is, because the root of true Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is in the free Judgement of our own reason, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every man does act freely, because he chooseth that which seemes best and most reasonable, not being constrained by any externall force or principle, but by the perswasion of his own minde.</p>
                  <p>If the Question be, <hi>Concerning the conversion of a sinner,</hi>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:205094:165"/>Gods Grace doth work powerfully, and Mans Will is but passive, or the subject whereon God doth work in the first act of our conversion, and not a cause co-operating with God, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore man is made a stock or stone,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     </label> because to will is of Nature, to will well is of Grace; so that when God frames us to will well, he doth not change or destroy the naturall faculty, but heales it, and leads it to a better Object; and this he doth <hi>non cogendo, sed suadendo,</hi> the soul sees the greatest reason in the world to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the greatest good which is now offer'd to it, and he doth thirst after it, and willeth it with all his heart and might; O give me Christ, or else I die; O give me Christ what ever he cost me. Is this to take away mans freedome, so freely to choose the best? And so fully to consent unto the will of God? Then Lord let my will never be free; Lord, set my heart at liberty, to run the way of thy Commandements, to run after thee,<note place="margin">

               </head>
               <p>IT is not my purpose in this Treatise, to follow every Brain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick Sectary in their Wild-goose Chase, nor to stand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on confutation of every absurd Sentence that falls from their pennes: many of their Fooleries are not worthy to be taken notice of. The materiall Errors cited in this Chapter are two.</p>
               <p>First, Concerning the ground and meanes of Faith, (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which, Faith will be accounted naturall, or supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral) their Error is thus expressed:</p>
               <div n="1" type="section">

                     <hi>They that are without the Gospell written or preached,</hi>

                     <hi>they that have only the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, the Sun, Moone, and Starrs, and the goodnesse of God in the Government of the world, have reason sufficient, if not in abundance, to think the same thoughts, and judge the same judgement with those that have the letter of the Gospell, (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the matter of believing.) For these two reasons are allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They have the substance of the Gospell, (namely) the willingnesse and readinesse of God to be reconciled unto the world preached unto them by those foresaid Apostles, the Sun, and Moone, and Stars, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Because in the Creatures they have sufficient meanes of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving. First</hi> that God is: <hi>Secondly</hi> that he is a rewarder of those that diligently seeke him, <hi>which is all the faith or beliefe that the Apostle makes simply and absolutely necessary to bring a man unto God, (that is) into grace and favour with him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Against these grosse Errors I lay down this positive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctrine. </seg>
                     </label>(namely) the substance of the Gospel; nay, not the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:205094:166"/>least glympse thereof is, or can be made known to us in the Creatures, and therefore they which want the Letter of the Gospel, have not means sufficient to bring them unto saving Faith; neither can they think the same Thoughts, nor judge the same Judgement, that they do, which have the Letter of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Sun, Moon, and Starres,<note place="margin">Two Branches of this Doctr.</note> and the Government of the World, are but dumb Apostles to preach the Mysterie of Salvation; the eternall power and Godhead are cleerly seen and understood by the things that are made, so that by this goodly frame of the World, the Sun, Moon, and Starres, men by naturall reason, may gather, that God is <hi>eternall,</hi> because he is before all things which are made; and <hi>powerfull,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he could make such a World of nothing; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, that the <hi>Godhead</hi> is not like to the <hi>Image of a corruptible Man, or Birds, or four-footed Beasts, or creeping things;</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all which forms the Heathens did worship a Deity, and <hi>served the Creature more than the Creator.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom 1.20.23 25.</note> The Apostle shews the vanity of mans imaginations, for it is contrary to reason, that God, which made the world, should be like unto such weak, dying, perishing Creatures.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Much more that such Creatures should be worshipped and served, prayed unto, or depended on for help; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he tells us, that in their base conceits of the Godhead, &amp; in their idolatrous Image-creature worship, they <hi>became brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish;</hi> they did not shew themselves men, and therefore were without excuse in that respect: A worshipper of Images, of Creatures, hath no excuse for his sin, because they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son enough to dictate the contrary. Now if in the great works of the Creation, they could not apprehend aright the nature of the Godhead; How shall they be able to see the find in them the hidden mysterie of the Gospel?<note place="margin">Col 1.26. Ephes 3.9. Ver. 10. 1 Pet. 1.11. Heb. 1.1.</note>
                     <hi>The mysterie that was hid from Ages and Generations, hid in God,</hi> hid from generations of Men, yea, from <hi>Angels</hi> in Heaven, to whom <hi>the manifold wisdome of God is made knowne by the Church: God at sundry times, and in divers manner, spake in times past unto the Fathers</hi> concerning <hi>Christ by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> But did he ever speak of Christ by the dumb Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:205094:167"/>What should I say more? The Apostle is cleare, <hi>The world by all its wisdome knew not God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.21.</note> till <hi>it pleased God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale it by the foolishnesse of preaching.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verse 8.</note> It never entred into the heart of man to think of <hi>Salvation</hi> by the <hi>Crosse;</hi> of an <hi>imputed Righteousnesse</hi> by a <hi>Mediatour,</hi> of <hi>God manifest in the Flesh, made under the Law,</hi> &amp;c. and many other such like points of the Gospel: none of these things ever <hi>entred into the heart of man to concieve;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.9.</note> the knowledge and belief of these things comes onely by hearing, and by the Revelation of Jesus Christ in the Gospel: All that ever studied Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, I mean the best and wisest of Heathen Philosophers, never sought it in a way of Faith, but in a way of Works, of morall correctives of Vice, and rules of common Justice, and humane Prudence. But did ever any one of them so much as dreame of a Mediator? or of Justification by Faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.<note n="2" place="margin">Branch.</note> Hereof follows the second Branch of our Conclusion (namely) that they which want the Light and Letter of the Gospel; have not sufficient means of Believing. The object of Faith is not revealed in the Creatures; How then can there be any Faith without the Gospel?<note place="margin">Rom. 14.15.</note>
                     <hi>How can they believe in him of whom they have not heard?</hi> ('Tis a thing impossible) and <hi>How can they hear without a Preacher?</hi> (that is also impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible;) A Preacher of the Gospel of peace, that brings glad tidings of good things? And <hi>how can they preach except they be sent?</hi> If there be no Sending, no Preaching, no Hearing, there can be no Believing. And so the Apostle concludes, ver. 17. <hi>So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> This is the onely true ground of Faith; and all that would get Faith, must hearken to the Gospel, as it was taught and published by the true and living Apostles of Jesus Christ, and is continued in the Church by such as succeed them,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.5.4.9. Rom. 1.5.</note> who are <hi>Ministers, by whom ye believe,</hi> and <hi>Labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers together with God,</hi> to make the World <hi>obedient to the Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason hereof is, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>
                     </label> because true Faith, whereby man is justified,<note place="margin">Faith is super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall in three respects.</note> is purely supernaturall, it is above Nature to teach it, or to work it. It is purely supernaturall, first, in respect
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:205094:167"/>of the Object, which is Christ crucified for our Sins; The things to be believed are above the reach of mans naturall reason; <hi>Flesh and blood hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven:</hi> This our Saviour spake of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16:17.</p>
                  <p>It is a lewd invention of some, to say, that Heathens might have an implicite Faith in Christ; that is, habitually to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all things contained in Scripture, although actually they knew not what was therein contained; and that an explicite particular belief of Christ was not then necessary. For they could not have none at all, because they had Christ for their Object: but <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that which might be known of God by the Creation. That distinction of <hi>Faith implicite</hi> and <hi>explicite,</hi> cannot take place where the object of Faith is not known and embraced. <hi>Implicite</hi> Faith is that of many weak Christians, who believe in Christ for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he died to save his people from their sins; or this they rest on, though many particulars touching the manner of the Incarnation, Death, Resurrection, Intercession of Christ, and of Justification, and of the Definition of Faith, &amp;c. be not clearely known to them; the Faith of <hi>Cornelius</hi> and the Eunuch was such. Faith <hi>explicite,</hi> is when Christians can distinctly go from point to point, manifesting their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the mystery of Christ. These two are but degrees of the same Faith, the one weak, the other strong, for they both meet in one Object, <hi>Christ Jesus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to tell of an implicite Faith in Heathens, which have a kind of knowledge of God, but not Christ for their Object, is an invention to delude the simple; they could have neither habit nor act of Faith, when as the object of Faith was altogether unknown to them.</p>
                  <p>Much after this manner do the Popish Priests delude their people, by the Doctrine of an implicite Faith; for they teach, that the people are not bound to know what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Faith be; it sufficeth that they believe, as the Church believes, upon assurance that the Church believeth all things necessary; but what those things are, which the Church believes, they need not inquire: Thus they exclude
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:205094:168"/>knowledge from Faith, and place it in Assent onely, in a blinde and generall Assent, whereas without Knowledge there can be no Faith; and without supernaturall Revelation there can be no knowledge of the things that are to be belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Faith is purely supernaturall, in regard of the manner of coming by it; it is given from above: To believe, is the work of God, as hath been sufficiently evinced in the former Chapter; and although, when we believe, we see suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to believe; yet to make the heart close with Jesus Christ, is an effect of Gods powerfull Grace. Hence it is that the Apostle prayes for the Thessalonians, that <hi>God would count them worthy of this calling, and fulfill all the good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of his goodnesse, and the work of Faith with power.</hi> 2 Thes. 1.11. in which place the Apostle teacheth two things: First that the whole beginning and progress of our salvation, is to be ascribed to the good pleasure of Gods goodness: Secondly, that the work of Faith is carried on with power; <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>author</hi> and <hi>finisher of our Faith,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.2. 1 Pet. 1.5.</note> and because it is so many waies assaulted, therefore <hi>by the power of God we are kept through faith unto salvation:</hi> And truly, what less than a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power is able thus to draw the soul to Christ? to forsake all, that we may be found in him? to forsake our own Friends, Houses, Lands, and present worldly enjoyments, for his sake? yea, which is most of all, to forsake our own Righteousness, and venture all upon an unseen Christ, upon a crucified Christ? to venture our precious Soules, and our eternall Condition upon one whom we <hi>never saw, yet believing we rejoyce with joy unspeakable, and full of glory.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.8 &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Faith is purely supernaturall, in regard of its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable effects and workings.</p>
                  <p>First, Inward, it <hi>purifies the heart;</hi> Secondly, it <hi>pacifies</hi> the <hi>conscience;</hi> Thirdly, it fills the heart with <hi>joy,</hi> even in the midst of <hi>tribulations;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 5.1. 1 Pet. 1.6, 7. Eph. 6.16.</note> Fourthly, it makes us able to <hi>withstand</hi> and to <hi>quench</hi> all the <hi>fiery darts</hi> of <hi>Sathan,</hi> and to fight, and overcome <hi>Principalities</hi> and <hi>Powers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Outward effects; you see the admirable effects
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:205094:168"/>of Faith in the Fathers, <hi>Noah, Abraham, Moses,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. who, by Faith, forsooke their owne Countrey, to live as Pilgrimes in a strange Countrey; chose Afflictions rather than worldly Honours, bearing up in doing the will of God against all the threats and wrath of Kings, as seeing him who is invisible; others, through Faith, subdued Kingdomes,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.33, 34.</note> wrought Righteousnesse, stopped the mouths of Lions, quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched the violence of Fire, out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 33.34.</p>
                  <p>Faith makes us overlook all difficulties and temptations, which may hinder us in the course of our obedience; it shews us the all sufficiency of God, his faithfulnesse and power; it worketh by love, and frames us to obey the will of God in all things, in difficult cases, in hard duties, which Nature abhorres (as <hi>Abraham</hi>'s sacrificing of his Son, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>)</p>
                  <p>Lastly, the victories of Faith are admirable, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4. <hi>This is the victory that overcometh the world, even our Faith;</hi> it overcomes the terrours and flatteries of the world; tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the right hand, and on the left; yea, it makes the soul overcome Death it self, yea, the worst of Deaths, that Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors could invent to inflict on the Servants of Christ, <hi>Re.</hi> 12.11.</p>
                  <p>Consider now what a thing Faith is; And can Nature do this? Such Effects as these, so farre above Nature, can they arise from a root in Nature? These supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and spirituall Effects shew that Faith is of a Divine and Heavenly Original.</p>
                  <p>Now you will easily perceive the weaknesse of these two Reasons, by which this Error is supported.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>It is alledged; that they, that are without the Gospel,</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label>
                     <hi>have sufficient meanes of believing, because they have the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnesse and readinesse of God, to be reconciled unto the word, preached unto them by those dumb Apostles, the Sun, Moon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the bountifulnesse of God in the government of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, in the Creatures, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> whereby God hath provided for our sustentation in this naturall life; we may gather, that <hi>God is good to all, and his Mercy is over all his Works; He preserveth both Man and Beast, he spreads a Table for
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:205094:169"/>every living thing, he opens his hand and filleth them with good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Again in the Creation of the world, and the Dominion given to man over the Creatures, we may see what honour and dignity the Lord put upon Man in his Creation; the Psalmists Meditation of Gods works is sweet, <hi>Psal.</hi> 8.3, 4. <hi>When I consider the heavens, the work of thy fingers, the Moon and the Starres, which thou hast ordained,</hi> then I think, <hi>What is Man?</hi> What a rare, excellent, honourable peice of the creation is Man, for whose use these things were made? If the Heavens, Sun, Moon, and Starres be so glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, how glorious a Creature is Man, that thou art <hi>mindfull of him, that thou hast crowned him with glory and honour,</hi> that <hi>thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands, that thou hast put all things under his feet, as Sheep, and Oxen?</hi> &amp;c. We may fitly meditate on our primitive greatnesse and excellency by Creation, and bewaile our sinfull Rebellions against so good a God: But what one Character of Gods Reconciliation to the World,<note place="margin">Two fold goodnesse of God. Mat. 5.45.</note> can be read in all this Book of the Creatures? Gods goodnesse to us, as we are Creatures, is one thing, and as we are Sinners, to be reconciled, is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the; the former is a generall Goodnesse, he is good unto all, and sendeth Rain upon the just and the unjust; yea, thus he is good to the bruit Creatures; But as for that spirituall goodnesse of God in sending his Son to die for us, this is not seen in the Creatures: Nay, farther, we that have the best improvement of the light of Nature, by the help of the light of Gods Word, cannot infer Gods readinesse to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the World by his cenerall goodnesse in governing the World: <hi>No man knowes Love or Hatred by all that is before him;</hi> twere but a wild and weak Argument to reason: God gave <hi>Esau</hi> a Blessing, <hi>Behold, thy dwelling shall be the fatnesse of the earth, and of the dew of heaven from above,</hi> Gen. 27.39. therefore God is willing to be reconciled to <hi>Esau</hi> in the blood of Christ. The generall goodnesse of God in Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and his spirituall mercies of Redemption, be not of the fame kind, they be different forts of mercies; neither can we conclude or infer the later for the former, they spring not from the same fountain.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, It is alledged, <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>That they have sufficient means of believing; First,</hi> that God is, <hi>Secondly, and</hi> that he is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder of them that diligently seek him, <hi>which (say they) is all the faith that is absolutely necessary to bring a man into fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour with God,</hi> Heb. 11.6.</p>
                  <p>I answer: First, If that generall Belief concerning God, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> were all the Faith that is necessary to Salvation, or if it be sufficient to bring men into favour with God, I do not see why the <hi>Devils</hi> may not be saved, seeing they <hi>believe</hi> the same.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.15.</note> This generall confused Belief is not all the Faith that is required: Our Saviour requires more, John 14.2. <hi>Ye believe in God, believe also in me;</hi> and again, Joh. 17.3. <hi>This is eternall life, that they might know thee the onely true God:</hi> But is that enough? No; but ye must adde, <hi>and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent;</hi> for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins; Christ saith, <hi>I am the way, the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me,</hi> John 14.6. therefore by the bare help and knowledge of the Creatures, no man can come unto God; he will miss his way, that misseth of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Forasmuch as the Apostle there speaketh of such a Faith, whereby we <hi>please God,</hi> and are accepted with him; therefore it cannot be meant of such a generall, philosophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call knowledge of God (as that he is the Almighty Creator and Governour of all things;) But what a God he is to us af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Fall, and that he is a Rewarder of them that seek help and relief by that way, which himself hath revealed, that is by Faith in the Mediatour: Faith is that Grace which unites us to Christ, in whom God is well pleased with us, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, except a man believe Gods All-sufficiency, and mercifull bountifulness in Christ to supply all his wants, he cannot come to him in a way that is acceptable: And so the meaning of the words is this, He that cometh unto God must believe, not only that <hi>he is</hi> Creatour and Governour of all things, but also Redeemer all-sufficient and gracious to relieve Sinners; and a that <hi>he is a Rewarder of them that seek him,</hi> not in a way of works <hi>legally,</hi> as the Heathens do, who conceive it shall go
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:205094:170"/>well with good men, and ill with wicked men; but <hi>evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> in a way of Faith in the Mediatour, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did, of whom it is testified, that though he were furnished with many other glorious vertues, yet by none of them did he please God, but onely by his Faith.</p>
                  <p>And for confirmation of this Exposition, some properties of justifying Faith are fitly noted, to be contained in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles words by Mr. <hi>Dickson, in loc.</hi> As first, <q>That it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a man sensible of his own indigence and misery, else it could not send him a begging. Secondly, it emptieth him of the confidence of his own, and all the Creatures help, else it could not send the man away for all these to God. Thirdly, it pointeth out God both able and willing to help, else it could not incourage a man to take course for relief in him. Fourthly, it setteth a man on work to use the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed meanes to finde God; and so it bringeth a man to deny himself, and to have communion with God:</q> This is the Faith spoken of in the Text, and it is not taught by the Creatures, nor found in them that want the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</p>

                  <p>First, It makes void the Gospel, and plucks up the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.11.</note> and sets up Salvation without Faith in Christ.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It makes voyd and needlesse the Ministery, and brings the preaching of the Gospel into a base esteem.</p>

                  <p>This Conclusion hath three parts or Doctrines,<note place="margin">Three parts.</note> which I will prove severally.</p>
                  <p>First, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>1</label> faithfull Actions, such as St. <hi>Paul</hi> commends in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> and S. <hi>James</hi> requires in every Believer, are not se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from true Faith, nor from the party justified; but they flow from faith inseparably, as effects and fruits thereof. This needs not long proof,<note place="margin">Acts 15.9.</note> for <hi>Faith purifies the heart,</hi> as the Spring doth purge it self from mud and dust, that is cast into it; so Faith and Lusts cannot lodge or dwell together, the believing heart will cast it out like poyson.</p>
                  <p>Again,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note>
                     <hi>Faith worketh by Love;</hi> It is a character, or mark, by which a sound Christian is known and distinguished from the unsound; it is not <hi>Circumcision,</hi> nor any such outward priviledge, or performance, that can make a good Christian, <hi>but Faith, that worketh by Love,</hi> (that is) that frames the heart to obey Gods will out of the love it beares to God; <hi>This is the love of God,</hi> an effect and sign of it; <hi>that we keep his Commandements,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 5.3.</note>
                     <hi>and his Commandements are not grievous;</hi> Faith believes God commanding, threatning, directing, as well as promising, and does yeild unto God a suitable obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to every part of the revealed Will of God cheerfully, it is not grievous; and universally to obey God in one thing as in another, because, as S. <hi>James</hi> sayes, there is the same authority and bond upon the Conscience in all the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,<note place="margin">Jam. 2.10, 11.</note>
                     <hi>God spake all these words;</hi> and he that said, <hi>Do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Adultery,</hi> said also, <hi>Do not kill;</hi> and therefore <hi>whosoever shall offend in one point,</hi> out of an evil conscience, or false heart, <hi>is guilty of all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Faith is it which carries us on in the course of Obedience, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>
                     </label> and the more Faith we have to see God in his All-sufficiency, and other Attributes, the more constant, sincere, and sound we are in our obedience; ye see the admirable effects of Faith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>By Faith Abel</hi> served God; <hi>Enoch</hi> walked with God; <hi>Noah</hi> went on with building his Ark against all the scoffs

Faith will make us follow God in difficult Duties and Promises; when Faith failes, then our Obedience failes: <hi>Abraham</hi> failed in denying his wife, through fear he fell, he conferred with carnall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, <hi>I thought they will slay me for my wives sake,</hi> Gen. 20.2.11.<note place="margin">Genes 20.</note> It is Faith that keeps us close to God.</p>
                  <p>The more are they to be wondred at, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> who plead for <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Faith,</hi> to make it justifying, yet think that true Faith does not alwaies bring forth good works, and that it is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to believe truly, and not to live accordingly, that a man may see and like the promises of spirituall and eternall Joyes, and yet for the present, embrace the contrary; and this, though it be not a Justifying Faith, yet it may be a True Faith, for so much as it is, or it is one part of true Faith.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pract. Cat</hi> l. 1.5.3. p. 42. Edit. 5. 1649.</note> I would call this rather the Faith of Devils, feigned and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Faith; it is not that <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, 1 Tim. 1.5. which is commended in all true Christians: See therefore that you approve the trunesse of your Faith by its fruits of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and although you will not bring your faithfull actions into the conditions of your being justified, yet bring them forth as fruits, witnessing that you are partakers of Christ, and that Christ liveth in you.</p>
                  <p>The second part of my Conclusion is this, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>2</label> Faithfull actions are separated from Faith in the act of justifying, or from the condition of Justification,<note place="margin">Justification by Faith only.</note> they are not joyned with Faith in that action: here Faith is alone, we are justified by Faith onely, without the help or concurrence of other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Actions. For the clear understanding of this, you are to remember,</p>
                  <p>First, That man, being guilty of the Breach of Gods Law,<note place="margin">Note 1.</note> is subject to the Penalty thereof, Condemnation; he cannot be restored again,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.56.</note> unless he bring a Righteousness to satisfie this Law again.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Righteousnesse is not our own inherent Justice, but the Obedience of Christ alone, whereby he ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:205094:172"/>the whole Law most perfectly for us. We affirm, that every child of God hath in him true sanctification and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.6, 11. Gal. 3.13. Rom. 10.4.</note> enabling him to Repentance, Hope, Charity, &amp;c. But we deny these, or any of them, to be the Justice, whereby the Bond of Gods law is answered, and we appeare righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Gods Judgement seat. But the very thing that makes us accepted as just, is the Obedience of Christ, not our faithfull Actions.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>White</hi>'s Way. pag. 258. 2 Cor. 5.99. Rom. 4.11.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <q>For the deriving of this Righteousnesse to us, two things must be done, one on Gods behalf, another on our own; that which God doth is the imputation of Christs Obedience to us for the pardon of our Sins, and making our Person acceptable, as if our selves had never sinned. That which we do, is believing in Christ, and so receiving that which God offereth: both which Actions, when they meet Gods offering Christ, and our receiving him, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification of the poore sinner is formally accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This Righteousnesse is derived to us by Faith only, without the concurrence of other Graces, or faithfull Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to compleat it; when we say <hi>Faith onely,</hi> the meaning is not to exclude Repentance, Love, and good works from Faith, seeing Faith is alwaies accompanied with good works, as the Sun is with its light, and Fire with heat; and though the works themselves justifie not, yet being the effects of the same Faith, have their proper use to sanctifie us, which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation, as well as Justification; Because God bringeth no man to glory by justifying him alone, but by sanctifying him also. The meaning then is, to exclude all other Graces and faithfull Actions from being either the Righteousnesse that makes us accepted to eternall life, or the meanes whereby that Righteousnesse is applied to us.</p>
                  <p>Of all the Graces wherewith the soule of the Christian is adorned; there is none of them that is accepted for our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse, but <hi>the Righteousnesse of Faith</hi> (that is) of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> who is <hi>the Lord our Righteousnesse,</hi> and is applied to us by Faith, and by no other Grace.</p>
                  <p>This is manifest in Scripture, which sets up Faith alone in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:205094:172"/>this businesse. Rom. 3.21. <hi>The righteousnesse of God without the law is manifested, even the righteousnesse of God, which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all, and upon all that believe, for there is no difference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Note first, That there is a <hi>Righteousnesse of God</hi> eminently so called,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.21.</note> besides the righteousnesse of the <hi>Law</hi> (which is Gods righteousnesse also) and that is the righteousnesse of God in Christ, even <hi>the righteousness of God by faith of Jesus Christ:</hi> Now this righteousnesse is manifested for our justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation <hi>without the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly note, How this Righteousnesse comes upon us; the Text saies, <hi>it is unto all</hi> has <hi>upon all that believe,</hi> here may seem to be a Tautologie, because it is said, <hi>The righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness of God by faith is upon all that believe;</hi> The righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Faith? upon all that have Faith? a Tautologie; No: But that plainly shews both what our Righteousnesse is, and what is the means of making it ours, namely, Faith alone; the righteousnesse of God is upon us by the faith of them that believe, not by any of their other Graces. It follows, ver. 24. <hi>Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Jesus Christ, therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace,</hi> Rom. 4.16. Now if faithfull actions, or works, were joyned, it were not of Faith alone, and if not of Faith alone, then not of Grace. But all is placed in Christ through Faith, v. 25. <hi>Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousnesse for the remission of sins.</hi> The Apostle goes on, ver. 27. <hi>Where is boasting then?</hi> (as if he should say) such a way of mercy is established, whereby <hi>boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting is excluded,</hi> that no one man may boast over another. <hi>By what Law</hi> is Boasting excluded? <hi>Of works? Nay,</hi> for if some have the condition of Works, they may boast over others that want them. By what Law then is boasting cut off? <hi>By the law of Faith;</hi> for Faith brings one and the same righteousness of Christ unto all, it stops all mouths, there is no difference between one and another in Christ Jesus, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Gentile,</hi> they are all one in <hi>Christ Jesus;</hi> there is no room for Boasting, and therefore not for Works; so the Apostle concludes, ver. 27. <hi>Therefore we conclude, that
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:205094:173"/>a man is justified by Faith without the deeds of the Law,</hi> that is, by Faith onely.</p>
                  <p>This is confirmed by <hi>Davids</hi> Testimony. <hi>David describeth the blessedness of a man;</hi> He is one, <hi>to whom the Lord imputeth righteousness without works,</hi> Rom. 4.6. (that is) the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Christ unto remission of Sins, without any of our works;<note place="margin">Verse 11.</note> for which cause it is called <hi>the righteousnesse of Faith.</hi> These exclusive terms, <hi>Not by the works of the Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Galat. 2.16.</note>
                     <hi>by Faith without the deeds of the Law; Righteousnesse without Works.</hi> These expressions do fully teach, that Faith is alone in this great businesse, that though Christians be adorned <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> many good Qualities and Graces, yet God hath onely regard to their Faith, which makes them to renounce all confidence in their own Works, and seek Life and Salvation in Christ, on whom they put their trust.</p>
                  <p>Here,<note place="margin">Caution.</note> for close of this second part of my Doctrine, you must remember, that when so great matters are put upon Faith alone; Faith now is not considered as a work or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, but in its relation to Christ, and as it is an act or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the soul receiving and apprehending Christ set forth to the sinning creature: as they that were stung with <hi>fiery Serpents</hi> in the wildernesse, were healed by looking upon the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> that was lifted up; so the wounded soule is cured of its Sins by looking unto <hi>Christ</hi> the Antitype, to that <hi>Brazen Serpent.</hi> And this <hi>looking</hi> is called by Christ himself <hi>believing,</hi> John 3.14, 15. <hi>As Moses lifted up the Serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternall life.</hi> And although the eye hath many other uses and objects, yet by none of them was the party healed of his deadly sting, but by looking on the Brazen Serpent: So Faith hath many other objects and uses in the Christian life, yet by none of them is the Sinner justified, but by apprehending or looking upon, and applying Christ set forth in the Promises of the Gospel, and resting thereon for Mercy and Salvation. Faith acts upon Christ in Heaven, and it acts upon our own hearts to subdue lusts, and frame it to obedience; By the former we are justified, not by the later.</p>

                     </label> an Objection must be answered; For it is objected, <hi>That when it is so often said, that we are justified by Faith without Works, without the deeds of the Law, that the Word</hi> [Works,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>and</hi> Deeds of the Law] <hi>in those places signifie one of these two things, either perfect le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall Obedience, or Circumcision, and such like Judaicall Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, and so it is truly said, we are justified by Faith without them, that is, without such perfect absolute unsinning Obedience, and without such Judaicall Observances, but yet not excluding, but including sincere Obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But are not your faithfull Actions the works and deeds of the Morall Law? That is, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> such as the Law requireth you to do? yes; why then they are excluded from Faith in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. S. <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth the works of the Ceremonial Law from having any hand in our justification, but not them one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but all works of the Moral Law also. For,</p>
                  <p>First, His words are generall, and without limitation, Rom. 46. <hi>Blessed is the man unto whom God imputeth righteousnesse without works,</hi> without any works; And ver. 5. <hi>to him that worketh not,</hi> (observers of the Ceremonial Law are not called workers) <hi>but believeth in him that justifieth the ungodly, to him his faith is imputed for righteousnesse:</hi> What works are they, the want whereof maketh one an ungodly man? Are they not works of the Morall Law? Yet he that hath not wrought them, but for lack of them deserves to be called an ungodly man; if he believe, his Faith is counted for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, S. <hi>Paul</hi> excludes the works of that Law that was given to all men, to the Gentiles, as well as the Jews;<note place="margin">Rom. 3.9, 10. Gal. 3.10. Rom. 4.15.</note> the works of that <hi>Law,</hi> which <hi>stoppeth every mouth,</hi> and <hi>curseth</hi> every Transgressor; that <hi>Law which worketh wrath,</hi> and <hi>by which is the knowledge of sin:</hi> This must needs be the Morall Law; for of the Ceremoniall Law none of these things can be affirmed; <hi>We have before proved</hi> (saith he, <hi>Ro.</hi> 3.9. namely, in his former dispute) <hi>both Jews and Gentiles, that they are all under sin,</hi> and therefore concludes, ver. 28.30. that <hi>a man is justified by Faith without the deedes of the</hi> Moral <hi>Law,</hi> the Gentiles Law, <hi>seeing it is one God, which shall justifie the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:205094:174"/>by Faith, and the Ʋncircumcision through Faith:</hi> Thus ye see the point clearly proved, namely, that we are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by Faith onely, without the deeds of the Moral Law, or any thing therein contained.</p>

                  <p>The third part of my Conclusion is this, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doctr. </seg>3</label> that faithful Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not required, as the onely things by which the man is justified.</p>
                  <p>First, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> Because the onely things by which a man is justified, is that which doth answer the Accusation and Sentence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which all Sinners lie before Gods Tribunall and Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment seat: What is that you will plead to the Law and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God at that day, why the Sentence of Death should not take hold of you? Will you plead your faithfull Actions? Can they answer the Law? Can you hope by them to be pronounced innocent, absolved from Death, and adjudged unto Life eternall? O no; then you will plead Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness; <hi>It is Christ that died and rose againe;</hi> he was <hi>made under the Law to redeem us that were under the Law;</hi> &amp;c. This is the thing, the onely thing, by which the Law is satisfied, by which we stand just and righteous before the Judgement seat of God; and therefore the onely thing by which a man is justified: The words thus broadly delivered, are a grosse and manifest falshood, there be not two onely things by which a man is justified; if Christs righteousnesse be indeed the onely thing, then our faithfull Actions are not.</p>
                  <p>If they are the onely things, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>2</label> by which the man is justified, then either first,<note place="margin">By enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</note> as Causes; secondly, or as our Evangelicall righteousness, accepted instead of the fulfilling the Law; third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or as the means of Application of Christs Righteousnesse; Fourthly, or as Conditions preparing the Subject to its Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or as a <hi>Causa sine quâ non,</hi> without which the party is not justified. But in no sound sense can our Actions, or any of our inherent Righteousnesse, be the onely things by which the man is justified: I will prove it by parts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Not as Causes, having any worthinesse in them, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the person should be accepted, partly because they are unperfect, and need pardon; and partly for that they are the gifts of Gods Grace, and so make us Debtors to him, and not him a Debtor to us.</p>

                     <pb n="325" facs="tcp:205094:174"/>2. Not as our Evangelicall Righteousnesse accepted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of our fulfilling the Law. Arminians teach,<note place="margin">Syn. <hi>Dort,</hi> 1 part p 291.</note>

                  <p>A grosse Error: For first, God spared not his own Son when he made his soule a sacrifice for Sin,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.32.</note> he exacted of Christ our Surety, full payment and satisfaction for all our sins, he did not abate him one ace, when he made him a curse for us.</p>
                  <p>The Reason hereof is, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>1</label> because the Law being part of Gods Will, and given to man out of the justice of God,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.26.</note> it must take its effect, that so <hi>God may be just, and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus:</hi> and so Christ satisfies the Word of his Father <hi>(Thou shalt die the death)</hi> and the conscience of the Sinner in that righteousnesse is full and perfect.</p>
                  <p>Gods Judgement is according to truth, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>2</label> and therefore he never pronounceth a man righteous, that is not so;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.4. Rom. 10.4.</note>
                     <hi>The righteousnesse of the law is fulfilled in us</hi> that <hi>believe.</hi> The Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God is no loser in justifying of the Elect freely, and for just nothing of their own.</p>
                  <p>If our Evangelicall Obedience were accepted to our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication instead of perfect legall Obedience, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> then we were ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by works, by the deeds of the Law, by an inherent Righteousnesse; for such are all our faithfull Actions, they are a conformity to the Law, and a part of that obedience which the Law requireth of us. He that fulfilleth the Law by perfect obedience, and he that obeyes it in all the parts of it sincerely, they both of them are workers; and if that which
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:205094:175"/>they do be their righteousness, then are they justified by the deeds of the Law.<note place="margin">The one hath it by Grace, the other of Debt.</note> Secondly, How then holds the difference assigned by the Apostle, between the Worker and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever in the manner of obtaining Righteousnesse? How sets he the Worker and Believer in direct opposition in the point of Justification? How doth he describe the righteousnesse of the Believer to be without works, Rom. 4, 5, 6 <hi>The Lord im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth righteousnesse without works;</hi> And what righteousness can that be? Inherent righteousnesse it cannot be, for that is not without works, it must needs therefore be Christs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.19.</note> according as it is said, <hi>By the obedience of one many are made righteous;</hi> Christs righteousness is made ours of God; 2 Cor. 5.21. <hi>We are made the righteousness of God in him</hi> (that is) righteous by such a righteousness, as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth and imputeth to us. Thirdly, Lastly, whatsoever may occasion <hi>beasting</hi> in man is <hi>excluded,</hi> Rom. 3.27. Now as great occasion of boasting is left to man in the act of Faith, and its Obedience, as in any work of the Law whatsoever, inasmuch as according to these mens doctrine, these would believe; others would not, though they had the same helps and means.</p>
                  <p>Note this therefore for conclusion of this point, that the Grace of the new Covenant does not stand in this, that God accepts our imperfect obedience <hi>loco impletionis totius legis,</hi> that God accepts a Pepper corn instead of his full Rent, as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> glosseth it, a jejune and empty conceit of so high a mysterie. But that glorious rich magnificent Grace of the Gospel, so much magnified and exalted by the Apostle to the praise and glory of Gods rich mercy and love to mankinde, stands in this, that whereas Gods justice doth require full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and he in justice might have required the same at our hands; he hath provided the Price, and accepts the full payment at the hands of our Mediatour.</p>
                  <p>Nor thirdly, as meanes to apply Christs righteousnesse. This is the preheminence of Faith to obtain this blessing of Righteousnesse at Gods hands, as hath been proved already. The righteousnesse of the Gospel is that which is performed in the person of Christ; 'tis He that died, and overcame:
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:205094:175"/>Now these personall actions cannot be ours by any other means, but by imputation, which is Gods gracious act ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing to us, what Christ did and suffered in our names, and counting it ours no lesse than if we had performed it in our own persons; and the thing imputed is not received, appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and applied by our Charity, or Repentance, or any other Grace, but by Faith onely.</p>
                  <p>Because the Grant of life, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>
                     </label> and Pardon of sins is made over to us in the Promises, which are the proper object of Faith, not of other Graces: the act and proper object of Charity, is Compassion to them that be in Misery; the proper act and object of Repentance, is Sorrow for Sin, &amp;c. So the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are the object of Faith: Promises are to be believed, and the soul receives them by Faith: See that place <hi>Rom</hi> 5.17. where Believers are described to be such, as <hi>receive the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Grace, and of the gift of Righteousness.</hi> Here is a gift (Righteousness of Christ) the Relative act to giving, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, namely, by Faith, as by an hand, so that Faith onely hath fitnesse to receive the gift of Righteousness, and it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the soul to rest on them in peace. And thus <hi>the just shall live by Faith</hi> on the Promises: But the Law is not of Faith, as if he should say, it is not enough to believe a Law, but you must do it: Look upon the Law, we do it; look upon the Promises, we believe them, and by faith in them we live, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.11, 12. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38, 39.</p>
                  <p>Nor lastly, are faithfull Actions the onely things by which the man is justified, or by a condition, as <hi>causa sine quâ non.</hi> We all acknowledge, that Faith, Repentance, new Obedience, are in a sound sense conditions required of all that be within the covenant of Grace,<note place="margin">What we hold touching con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicions in the persons justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> and all that look to be <hi>justified</hi> by the <hi>Blood of Christ,</hi> must be also <hi>sanctified by the Spirit of Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.11. so Acts 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptised for the remission of sins;</hi> so 1 John 1.6. <hi>If we say that we have fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie.</hi> We freely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that God, who doth <hi>justifie the ungodly,</hi> that is, all humble, broken, laden sinners, that come unto him for just nothing, without consideration of any thing in them, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him thereunto, will never justifie an impenient Infidell,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:205094:176"/>one that goes on still in his wickedness.<note place="margin">An inseparable connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Sanctification.</note> We strictly and vehemently urge, that there is an inseparable connexion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Justi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ation</hi> and <hi>Sanctification</hi> in the Sinner, that is received unto mercy (though we deny a dependance of Justification upon Sanctification) and that upon these grounds.</p>
                  <p>First, From the nature of Faith; Faith is wrought in the heart by the Gospel, which does humble the Sinner, and shews him his misery, and so drive him unto Christ for help. This same Faith doth both justifie us, as it acts upon Christ set forth a propitiation for Sin; and it sanctifies us, as it acts upon our own hearts, purging out the naturall filthinesse that is in it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From our In-being in Christ, as the Root, <hi>He that hath the Son,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 John 5.12:</note>
                     <hi>hath life.</hi> And we that were <hi>a wild Olive-tree</hi> by nature, being <hi>planted</hi> into <hi>Christ,</hi> our wild Nature is changed, and we partake of the <hi>fatnesse</hi> of the <hi>true Olive,</hi> (that is) of the Graces that be in Christ the Root, of whose fulnesse we receive in our measure, and are become new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From the Nature of Christs Death, which as it hath a Merit to expiate all Sin; so it hath an Efficacy with it to crucifie the Old man with its Lusts. The <hi>Blood</hi> of the old <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> sprinkled on the Sinner, did <hi>sanctifie to the purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Flesh.</hi> Much more doth the <hi>Blood of Christ purge the Conscience</hi> (not onely from <hi>guilt</hi>) but <hi>from dead works to serve the living God,</hi> Heb. 9.13.</p>
                  <p>Let us consider a little what influence the Death of Christ hath into our Mortification, and Sanctification; what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it hath into our Justification, is evident.</p>
                  <p>But how it does destroy the power of Sin in us, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Quest. </seg>
                     </label> is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether so obvious and clear.<note place="margin">A Digression.</note>
                     <hi>Christ died, therefore Sin dieth in me; What is the reason of that Inference? How hath that Death upon the Crosse an influence into my heart to kill Sin in me? Is it onely by way of Congruity, as because Christ died for my sins; therefore I should hate Sin, which God so much ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and which put Christ to that cursed death? That's some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that's not all; for Christs Death doth kill Sin in us
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:205094:176"/>efficaciously,</hi> Rom. 6.6. our Old man is crucified with Christ, that the body of Sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve Sin.</p>
                  <p>This comes to passe by vertue of our communion with him; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label>
                     <hi>If one died for all, then were all dead,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.14.</note> and our Old man is cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified with Christ. But before our Old man can be crucified with Christ,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It must be imputed unto him,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.24.</note> He took our whole <hi>Sin</hi> and fault upon <hi>himself,</hi> he was made as it were, a lump of Sin, and so he stood upon the Crosse as clothed with old <hi>Adam</hi> with our Old Man, having as it were the <hi>hand-writing of Ordinances, which was contrary to us,</hi> hanging about his neck.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Now this whole body of Sin he <hi>nailed to the Cross,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Col. 2 14.</note> he <hi>took it out of the way;</hi> he did not onely condemn Sin in his Flesh, but he destroyed the power of Sin in the World, and that two manner of waies:</p>
                  <p>First,<note place="margin">How Christ destroyed the power of Sin. 1 John 3.8.</note> Because in his Cross he <hi>spoyled Principalities and Powers,</hi> the Spirits which ruled in the Children of Disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the Prince of the World was judged. <hi>Christ</hi> was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested to <hi>destroy the works of the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Pactionally, because having performed that work, he received <hi>the Promise of the Father,</hi> that is, the holy Ghost, that he should have <hi>life in himself,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1 16.</note> and <hi>execute Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> to <hi>turn the people of Israel to the Lord,</hi> and that he should <hi>see of his seed,</hi> Isa. 53.10, 11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This being done by Christ our Head, as a publique Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in the room of all the Elect, we having Communion with him by Faith,<note place="margin">Col. 2.12, 13.</note> are made partakers of all that he did or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or conquered; all is as really ours, as if we had done it in our own persons: As in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> there was a Spring of humane Nature corrupted, derived unto us by naturall Generation; so in the second <hi>Adam</hi> there is a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the same nature restored, and derived unto us by spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Regeneration, so that by fellowship with Christ in his Sufferings, our Body of Sin is destroyed; and we have from him an imputed Sanctification, as well as an imputed Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse; 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>He is made unto us Wisdome, and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:205094:177"/>and Sanctification.</hi> Pardon this little Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p>Thus you see that we urge Holiness &amp; Sanctification, &amp; the necessary connexion thereof with Justification, upon as sure and strict grounds, as they which make them conditions of Justification; and in our ordinary preaching we do not make nice to call <hi>Faith, Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Holiness,</hi> the <hi>conditions</hi> of the <hi>New Covenant,</hi> the <hi>way</hi> for the <hi>ransomed</hi> to <hi>walk in,</hi> which way whosoever findeth not, or having found it, walketh not, shall never be saved, because God saveth none but by Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Sanctification both; The former is to acquit us from the Condemnation of the Law, the latter is to conforme us to the Gospel, and to go the way that leads to God.</p>
                  <p>But when we meet with men of corrupt Principles,<note place="margin">How we deny Conditions.</note> which first deny Faith to justifie, as an instrument relatively, but onely as a Condition within us, that is, as a Qualification, or Act; secondly, that <hi>fides loco impletionis totius legis;</hi> thirdly, which set up our works, and rank them with Faith in the point of Justification, so that those glorious things, which are spoken of Justification by Faith, are affirmed also of other Vertues and faithfull Actions, and Faith is no more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Graces,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Such broad, materiall, effectuall conditions, pulling down Faith, that it shall be but as a single Star in the constellation of Graces, and setting up Works in the same Throne and Dignity, we detest, as tending directly to subvert the Gospel of Salvation, in like sort as the Papists do by their doctrine of works. We deny with the Apostle the union of our works with Faith, as to our Justification, and we perform them as Duties, whereunto God hath tied us, upon other terms, namely, as the fruits of Faith, the way by which God will lead us to himself. Our learned Divines do explain it by this comparison: <q>Even as a King freely bestowing a place in the Court upon his Subject;<note place="margin">

                  <p>Now it remains that I prove the fourth Branch of my third Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Here I will consider two things; First, <label type="milestone">

Secondly,<note place="margin">The Case sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> Whether <hi>faithfull Actions,</hi> or the <hi>purpose</hi> of them be indeed an <hi>Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Condition,</hi> or <hi>Qualification</hi> of the Subject to its <hi>Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> to make him capable thereof?</p>
                  <p>To the former, I say, that it is not a fit <hi>salvo;</hi>
                     <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position it self <hi>in terminis,</hi> being untrue, the limitation is very flat, because the word <hi>(onely things)</hi> impots more than a personall qualification, even that condition, which is onely in the Person of Christ. Why saies he not plainly, they are the <hi>onely personall Conditions,</hi> and not the <hi>onely Things,</hi> seeing no personall conditions whatsoever are the things by which the man is justified?</p>
                  <p>Let us consider expressions scattered up and down in that <hi>Practicall Catechism,</hi> and then judge whether limitation (as by a Condition) be a pertinent <hi>salvo</hi> to make the fense good: For instance, <q>Many acts of <hi>Abrahams</hi> Faith are mentioned in the New Testament, but especially two there are, by which, in two trialls of his Faith, he approved himself to God, so far, as that God imputed them to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, that is, accepted of those Acts of his as graciously,<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Pract Cat</hi> S. 3. p. 29. p 33.</note> as if he had performed unsinning Obedience, had lived ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly without any slip or fall all his life. And again, a little after, he saith, that will hold true of you (as of <hi>Abraham</hi>) that if your heart be sincerely given up to Christ, if there be in you a resolution of uniform Obedience unto Christ, and
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:205094:178"/>such as would hold in time of Temptation; This will be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly accepted by God to thy Justification; nay, if God try thee onely with one Promise (be it spirituall or tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall) if thou confidently depend on the Truth without any doubting, this will be accepted of God to thy Justification without any farther acts of Faith, or Obedience to his Commands, in case, or supposing there were no such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand as yet given to thee: But if our receiving of Christ in heart and resolution be such, as will not fructifie in its due season, it is not fit to be accepted by God to our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe here two grosse Errors; First, That the thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted, and accepted to our Justification, is our own Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (in Resolution or Performance.) Secondly, That God accepteth those acts of Faith instead of, or as well as if we performed perfect unsinning Obedience: Whereas the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is full and cleare, that the thing accepted and imputed to our Justification, is not our weak imperfect Obedience, residing in, and performed by our own selves, but the spot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and all-sufficient Righteousnesse of Jesus Christ, perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Christ, residing in the Person of Christ, and imputed of God unto us. That which is imputed to us, is not inherent in us, it is not our owne: Righteousnesse imputed and inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in this dispute, are quite contrary; if it be imputed it is not inherent; if it be inherent, it is not by imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Now let us apply the <hi>Salvo,</hi> and see if it can make the sense sound Doctrine; God doth graciously accept sincere acts of Obedience instead of unsinning Obedience to the whole Law (as a condition in the Subject to be justified) absurd.</p>
                  <p>For then first, Mans personall Obedience is the materiall cause of his Justification, as truly and really as perfect Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in <hi>Adam,</hi> was his Righteousnesse; for by their own do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they both are accepted: This is indeed to make the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel a covenant of Works, a conditionall Covenant: In the Covenant of Works (which is properly conditionall) there were but two Persons, God promising Life, and Man with his personall conditions of Obedience; and here it is true,
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:205094:178"/>God did accept his Creatures obedience as the condition or termes, on which he performed his part of the Covenant. But in the Covenant of Grace, there is a third Person, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Mediatour; and here the Mediatours righteousnesse is that which is accepted instead of perfect legall Obedience; his Obedience is the onely condition, upon which depends the fulfilling of all the mercies of the Covenant, the Sinners righteousnesse is not considered: This is the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Law and Gospel, that Covenant was performed for the Righteousnesse which should have been found in our selves; but here the things covenanted are applied and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the righteousnesse of the Mediatour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Consider the inconsistency of the Proposition, with its limitation: A condition (he saith) hath no efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it; but if God accept any thing instead of the whole Law, that thing is of greatest efficiency. To affirm that mans faithfull Actions are the things imputed, and accepted to his Justification, yea, that they are accepted instead of perfect Obedience, is to make them more than Conditions. Even Ingredients constituting a fit matter to be accepted on our behalf; they are now made intrinsecall to the matter of our Justification, as with which they are compleat and fit to be accepted, and without which it is not fit to be accepted by God to our Justification, whereas Conditions qualifying the person, are altogether extrinsecall to the matter of our Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>It is then a meer Gull, to say that our own actions do ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie, as Conditions or Qualifications of the Person, seeing no personall Condition or Qualification whatsoever, doth justifie, that is, is imputed, or accepted to our Justification; It is as if a Jesuite should defend the Popes infallibility, by saying the Pope is the infallible, and unerring Judge of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies, not as a Man, but as Head of the Church, or that he hath power over Temporalties in order unto Spirituals, whereas there is no such order, no such headship over the Church. Thus of the first Question.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether faithfull Actions,</hi>

                     <hi>or the purpose of them be indeed an Antecedent Condition or Qualification of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:205094:179"/>to its Justification, to make him capable thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer: <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> First, Take Faith as a condition, that is, in a Notion distinct (from Instrument or Relative) it is no other than a work of ours, as any other vertue is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, and then take Faith with all its actings upon Precepts, Promises, Commandements, Threats, with all your Obedience, giving up your heart to God in all things; take all together, they have in them no other than the nature of good Works, good Qualities and Actions.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, And although by them the party justified, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from him that is not justified, and a true Believer from a false, yet none of these good works, nor all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, are the conditions of a Sinners Justification. This is proved.</p>
                  <p>The first Reason is from the nature of the free Covenant of Grace; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason. </seg>
                     </label>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 3.24.</note> the summe whereof is, that <hi>we are justified freely by his Grace, through the Redemption that is in Christ,</hi> from all our sins, without consideration of any thing that we could do or suffer: God receives a sinner into favour <hi>gratis,</hi> for just no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.6.</note>

                     </gap>
                     <hi>wherein he hath freely accepted us in the beloved one.</hi> In which place note two things; First, that there is nothing in us mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Lord to make this covenant of Mercy and Promises, freely by his Grace. Secondly, that there is nothing in us as a consideration, ground or condition of fulfilling those Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises being made,<note place="margin">1 John 2.11.</note>
                     <hi>Your sins are forgiven for his names sake:</hi> All we have is by a deed of Gift, 'tis all <hi>gratis,</hi> of meer mercy and good will.</p>
                  <p>I illustrate it by this comparison of two Beggars, Both come to a rich man, bewail their case, they say they must starve and perish if thou relieve us not, &amp;c. But the one pleads thus, Sir, Though you have now forgotten me, yet I have been an ancient Servant to you and your Father, I ever wished well to your Family, I never did purloyn or wast your goods, &amp;c. And though I have now plaid the lewd Prodigall, yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you to pity me in my miserie: This man cries out of his want and misery, but he brings a consideration or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to move pity. The other brings nothing but words of
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:205094:179"/>Aggravation and self-condemnation; Sir, I confesse I have hated you, and been your enemy, I have plotted your ruine; I have spoken and done all the mischief I could against you, you may hang me, &amp;c. yet I beseech you Sir, pity me in my misery. Here is no qualification or consideration to move pity; none at all. This is the Sinners case, he comes heavy laden, his sins like a talent of Lead upon his Conscience, and in bitternesse of spirit cries out, Lord be mercifull to me a sinner; I have sinned against Heaven and against Thee; I am as full of sin and misery as the Devil can make me, I have been an ungodly wretch untill this moment, have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, and according to the multitude of thy compassions, do away all mine offences: O, may such a vile wretch come? Yes: Shall he find pardon? Yes, <hi>I will ease you.</hi> O but I can say nothing for my self; yet <hi>come without money, or money worth:</hi> I am the worst of Sinners, I have not a good motion in my heart: Men and Brethren, what shall I do? Christ calleth thee, <hi>Come unto me, and I will give thee rest.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 9.13. 1 Tim. 1 16, 16</note> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Prodigall fell upon his neck, and kissed him. All that the Devil, or thy own Conscience, can make of thee, is but a Sinner, a chief Sinner, an ungodly Person, and such Christ came to call. Rom. 4.5. <hi>God</hi> is said to <hi>justifie the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> (that is) an ungodly person coming to Christ, is accepted, and hath his sins forgiven; of unjust he is made just; the state of a sinner, when pardoning mercy doth first acquit him, is a state of guilt and condemnation.</p>
                  <p>The proper subject of Justification,<note place="margin">The subject of Justification, Who.</note> or of pardoning Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a guilty Soule, it findes the person ungodly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wrath it sets him at liberty, it sayes unto him, thou shalt not die, thy sins be forgiven thee. <hi>Terminis à quo,</hi> the state from which a Sinner is brought, is a state of sin and wrath; <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus ad quem,</hi> the state unto which he is brought, is a state of righteousness imputed, whereby he is now a just man, his sins all covered, and he made a blessed man, <hi>Medium per quod,</hi> the meane by which the guilty party doth passe from Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to life is Faith, given us at this instant of our Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, not as a condition pre-existent in the party to be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, but as an instrument enabling the Soul now to reach
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:205094:180"/>forth it selfe to lay hold on Christ thus freely offered, and to close with the Lord Jesus. Even as the hand of a Beggar or a Prisoner doth reach forth it selfe to receive a gift to pay his debts. In the same Minute of time, a man is ungodly, and justified; an Enemy, and a Friend; As Christ made <hi>the blinde to see</hi> (that is) him, which just now was blinde, so God doth <hi>justifie the ungodly,</hi> (that is) him that just now was ungodly; when he came to Christ he was ungodly, <hi>when we were enemies, we were reconciled</hi> (that is) he that just now was an enemy, is reconciled; till he received his pardon he was an enemy; And what qualifications and conditions are, or can be found in such a person, to make him capable of his Justification?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Yes,</hi>

                     <hi>his sorrow for that is past, and his purpose to be ungodly no more, his giving up himselfe to sincere obedience for time to come. This is the condition of his being pardoned, and received into mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is true; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> All this God looks for at his hands, and gives him grace to do so, God having received him, and forgiven him all his sins, lets fall all Actions against the sinner, and so makes him a blessed man; God doth now expect that he should hold up no weapon against him, but walk in upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse before him. But this is not the condition of his being pardoned for sins past; God pardons him freely, without consideration of any thing that he hath done, or can doe hereafter. Sincere obedience is due every day, and may be a condition of our continuance in Gods favour; But how can it be accepted for sins of times past? Are sins past pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned upon that condition? But these are duties required of us upon other termes, as hath been shewed in the comparison of a beneficiall Office freely bestowed by the King on his Subject; he cannot say that his discharge of the place was a condition of the Kings bestowing it, for the Kings free gift put him into the place; but it is a duty which that gift calleth him unto.</p>
                  <p>This leads me to my second reason, taken from the nature of Gospel-conditions, they are gifts of the New Covenant promised, therefore not conditions pre-required properly;
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:205094:180"/>God gives us the Grace for time to come, to become new creatures; God gives <hi>Repentance,</hi> as well as <hi>Remission of sins;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 5.31.</note> God gives the <hi>new heart;</hi> and therefore these things which God himself worketh, cannot be conditions as unto him to pardon our sins. Indeed this sincere hearty resigning us our selves unto the Lord, may be to us a condition of our Peace, and an help to apply the Promises to our own souls in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular evidences to see our selves in the state of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. There is a double Act of Faith, one <hi>direct,</hi> pitching the soule upon Christ; and this is it by which I am justified, from whence doth arise in the soule a secret joy and peace, and a wonderfull love to Christ, and a willingnesse to live unto him, to resign up our selves unto him, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The other Act of Faith is <hi>Reflexe,</hi> whereby the soule looks inward to try its state,<note place="margin">Sincere Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our comfort, not of our Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it self.</note> and finding these holy dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wrought in the heart, whereunto are annexed promises of Mercy and Salvation; he concludes himselfe to be the Lords; he can say, <hi>I am Christs, and Christ is mine.</hi> Note here that I am justified because I believe in Christ, not because I finde that my Faith is sound; howbeit, by this I gather boldnesse and joy in believing: These gracious Purposes, and faithfull Actions, are not the ground of my believing, but of my applying. He that believes, and repents, shall be saved: I believe and repent, therefore I shall be saved. These gracious Qualities in the heart do not at first produce Faith, they are not the Mother of Faith, they are the <hi>fruits</hi> of our <hi>Marriage</hi> unto <hi>Christ,</hi> Rom. 7.4. yet the Daughter may nourish the Mother in time of neede; so doe these Graces comfort the Soule, and witnesse our fellowship with Christ.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But unlesse I do believe and repent, I shall not be saved,</hi>

                  <p>True, because God doth <hi>justifie</hi> none, <label type="milestone">

                     <note place="margin">The new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant not properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionall. Heb 8.6, 11, 12.</note> as <hi>Sarah</hi> did, and in point of <hi>Duty,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> did, yet we are not forthwith unjustified, the Covenant of mercy is not forfeited; for one of those <hi>better promises</hi> belonging to the <hi>new Covenant,</hi> is to <hi>pardon</hi> the <hi>failings</hi> of the <hi>Covenanters:</hi> Better Promises, because God doth not onely keep that Faith which is in all Covenants (namely) to perform his Promise, if we perform our Duty; But he promiseth also to forgive our failings, and cause us to fear him; he does not take the forfeiture upon our failings, but pardons us; <hi>If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous,</hi> &amp;c. If the Covenant were purely conditional, if it were grounded upon our Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as a condition, or consideration, then that fayling, it were lost and forfeited (as in the first Covenant, which was truly conditionall) but it being grounded on Christ, there is a standing Righteousnesse unto which we may <hi>have recourse to obtaine mercy,</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reas. </seg>3</label> they be emptying Graces, they do not bring any condition or consideration with them. Faith finding nothing at home, seeks and receives all from another: Faith makes us deny our selves, renounce our own righteousnesse, it sends us to Christ with an open hand, which lets fall all that was in it to receive a pardon at Gods hand, as a Beggar doth an almes: See how the Apostle doth abase and empty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, Phil. 3.7, 9. <hi>What things were gaine to me, those I counted losse for Christ; yea, and I count all things but dung, that I may win Christ, and be found in him, not having mine owne righteousness,</hi> &amp;c. Faith is <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ssive</hi> in receiving the Pardon; it is the hand or instrument of the soule to receive Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises. Now the Gift is most free and unconditionall, yet it must be received by the party that needs it, else it will do him
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:205094:181"/>no good; and that is all that Faith hath to doe to make us Sons; <hi>As many as received him, to them gave he power to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Sons of God,</hi> John 1.12.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, So for Repentance, it is an emptying Grace; Repentance makes us abhor our selves, accuse, judge, and condemn our selves, and put our mouth in the dust, and be dumb before the Lord. Now how can that which condemnes me, be a condition of my pardon? A Condition doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish me with a Plea, why I should have this or that; but Faith and Repentance do cast away all such Pleas, empties us of all goodnesse, laies us low at Gods feet, as a company of condemned Creatures, every one saying,<note place="margin">Pract.

                     <hi>I am no more worthy to be called thy Son.</hi> Does this Faith look like a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stellation of Graces;</hi> all which together is that Faith, which is required as that condition of our being justified? A strange Faith; for by this reckoning sorrow for sin is a part of Faith, and so is Charity, and so is Temperance, &amp;c. and all these to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether make up a lusty condition of our being justified. This is that Condition we deny.</p>

                  <p>These good works, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>4</label> purposes of obedience, &amp;c. which make up the condition of our being justified, doe they go before the pardon of our sinnes, or follow after? if they go before, they are the works of an enemy, and cannot qualifie us for a pardon;<note place="margin">Heb. 11.6.</note> for they need pardon themselves: if they follow after, then they are not conditions, because the work is done already, the person being already justified by his faith; he cannot be justified by those duties, which follow after, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you will say that the continuance of our justification doth depend upon perseverance in those holy purposes, and so as our first entrance into a state of Justification was upon condition of works, so our standing in that grace is owed to sincere obedience: Both which are directly contrary to the Apostles doctrine,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.17. Heb. 3.14.</note> who teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.2. that both our <hi>accesse</hi> and our <hi>standing</hi> in that <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>favour of God,</hi> is <hi>by faith:</hi> it is <hi>from faith to faith;</hi> and the Apostle declares his whole <hi>justification</hi> both in his first <hi>conversion,</hi> and in that <hi>time,</hi> wherein he wrought, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9, 10. Yea, at the <hi>day of Resurrection,</hi> to be wholly absolved and finished in faith. Here come two grand Arguments for <hi>union of works</hi> with <hi>faith:</hi> First, That <hi>without which</hi> (in Saint <hi>James</hi> his opinion) <hi>we are not justified,</hi> and <hi>by which,</hi> joyned with <hi>faith, we are justified,</hi> that is not excluded from <hi>faith,</hi> or the condition of <hi>justification:</hi> But required together with <hi>faith,</hi> as the only things by which (as by a condition) the man is <hi>justified:</hi> But <hi>without actions of faith</hi> (in Saint <hi>James</hi> his opinion) <hi>we are not justified,</hi> and <hi>by them we are justified, and not by faith only;</hi> therefore faithfull Actions are not excluded, but required to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with Faith, as the onely things by which (as by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition) the man is justified.</p>
                  <p>To which I answer three things; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, That the foundation of the Argument laid down in
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:205094:182"/>the major Proposition, is absolutely false, which in plain termes is this (namely) that Faith alone doth not justifie, but that Works are joyned with Faith in the Act of justify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (for so are the expresse words, by which, joyned with Faith, and required together with Faith) and therefore the Minor is totally to be denied, which assumeth and affirmeth, that without faithfull Actions joyned with Faith, we are not justified, and with them we are. This Error I have suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently confuted in the second part of my Conclusion, of this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Sect. of this Chap.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer, there is a two-fold joyning with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as (of Works with Faith) first, one as fruits are with the tree, or as fellow-qualities in the same subject; secondly, as fellow-workers to the same effect; in the former sense, Works are joyned with Faith, not in the later: I illustrate it thus, In Fire there be two qualities joyned together, Heat and Light; without light fire does not heat the water, because fire is not without light, yet the light conduceth nothing to the heating of the water. Now it would be a Sophisme thus to argue, that without which the fire doth not heat the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with which joyned together, it doth heat it, that is the thing by which the water is made hot; because, though they be joyned together as fellow-qualities in the same sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, yet not as fellow-workers to make the water hot: So it is a grosse fallacy to prove the union or concurrence of works with faith to our Justification, because faithfull Actions are never separated from faith; for though they be fellow-qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities in the same sanctified soul, yet they are not fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-workers to our justification in any sense whatsoever; Faith must so justifie, that (in that work) no other thing may share in it, no, not Repentance it selfe. To the words then I answer, that in this present Argument, those words (<hi>without which,</hi> and <hi>by which</hi> joyned) do note not a presence, or an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sociation of faith and works, but a concurrence in that great work; we are justified by faith with works, <hi>associative</hi> (faith is not without) but not by faith and works <hi>copulative:</hi> Now in the Argument faith and works are coupled as fellow-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers to the same effect; and therefore that Assertion I ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly reject.</p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:205094:183"/>
                  <p>Whether this is St. <hi>James</hi> his Opinion, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>3</label> that works are joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with Faith in the act of Justification; How does that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare? By St. <hi>James</hi> his direct affirmation, Chap. 2.24. <hi>Ye see then, that by works,</hi> that is, by actions of faith, <hi>a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and not by faith onely;</hi> and again, ver. 20. <hi>Faith without works is dead,</hi> and so not such, as by which we are justified.</p>
                  <p>I answer, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> first, We must gather the Apostles meaning from the drift of the place, which is not to shew what place Faith hath in justification, for that is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> drift, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. but to shew what faith it is that hath place in justification against <hi>Solifidians.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Christian Syn. pag. 43.</note> So the learned <hi>Weemse,</hi> whereto our learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> seems to accord, saying, <q>That S. <hi>James</hi> dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling not with the Jewes, but with another kind of Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,<note place="margin">Pract. Cat. 5. Edit. p. 32.</note> presumptuous Fiduciaries, hath no occasion to adde that exclusive part to shut out Works, but rather to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, or cure that other disease, which he saw in the mindes of men, through mistake and abuse of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Doctrine, possessed with, or subject to, thinking that a dead habit of faith would serve the turn. <hi>And some few lines before,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as S. <hi>James</hi> saith, ver. 21. that <hi>Abraham was justified by works;</hi> he expounds it thus (namely) That his faith did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove its self by faithfull actions, particularly, by offering up his Son.</q> Now if this be the drift of S. <hi>James</hi> (as it is most clearly) then it cannot reasonably be imputed to St. <hi>James,</hi> as his opinion, that a man is both justified by works, and by faith joyned together: But that by the works of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Rahab,</hi> their faith was justified and declared to be a true and living, not a false and dead faith; yea, they themselves were thereby justified and declared to be true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers indeed, truly righteous before God, and not in shew and profession onely.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>2</label> To the place it self of <hi>James</hi> 2.24. <hi>Ye see then, how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith onely.</hi> I answer, that the words are not copulative, as if a man were justified both by works and saith; but disjunctive, containing two parts, one Affirmative, <hi>by works a man is justified;</hi> the other Negative, <hi>not by faith onely;</hi> and both parts are true, according to the Apostles scope and argumentation. First,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:205094:183"/>
                     <hi>By works a man is justified;</hi> you must understand as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, ver. 21. that is, he was justified and declared to be a true Believer, and a righteous Person, when he offered up <hi>Isaac; (Now I know that thou fearest God,</hi> it was now declared, <hi>see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou hast not withheld thy Son,</hi> Gen. 22.12.) God had made triall before of <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, and <hi>counted it to him for righteousnesse; Abraham</hi> was justified before <hi>Isaac</hi> was born, <hi>Gen</hi> 15.6. And now the Lord makes a new trial of his faith in a point of obedience (namely) the offering up of <hi>Isaac;</hi> and by this experiment God justified the fidelity of <hi>Abraham.</hi> This act of Obedience crowned and renowned his faith, <hi>inasmuch as he, which had received the Promises, offered up his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son,</hi> Heb. 11.17. and <hi>against hope, believed in hope, he staggered not at the promise of God, and therefore it was imputed unto him for righteousnesse,</hi> Rom. 4.18, 20, 22.<note place="margin">James 2.21.</note>
                     <hi>Was not Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham our Father justified by works, when he offered up his Son?</hi> How does St. <hi>Iames</hi> prove that he was? By the testimony of Scripture, ver. 23. <hi>And the Scripture was fulfilled, which saith,</hi> Abraham <hi>believed God, and it was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse.</hi> He saith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was <hi>justified by works,</hi> v. 21. and proves it, because the Scripture saies, he was <hi>justified by faith:</hi> A strange proof, but of great force, to shew that <hi>by works,</hi> here S. <hi>James</hi> understands a working faith; for the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of <hi>Isaac</hi> was a manifest signe that <hi>Abraham</hi> believed God, <hi>being fully perswaded, that what he had promised,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 4.21.</note>
                     <hi>he was able also to perform;</hi> it was <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith that made him ready to perform such an act of Obedience; Faith wrought this great work, and what could Faith do more to shew it self a perfect Faith? Faith doth grow stronger and stronger, the more it is exercised; and by works faith is made perfect, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> it attaines its end, as the Tree is perfect, when he hath brought forth his Fruit, and untill he hath yeilded his fruit, he is not perfect: And from this example S. <hi>James</hi> doth gather, ver. 24. that he faith by which a man is justified, is not a bare profession of the Gospel, but such a faith as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> was, fruitfull in works of obedience.</p>
                  <p>So secondly, The other part of the Text <hi>[not by Faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly]</hi> is to be understood of the bare profession of Faith, which
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:205094:184"/>can yeild no solid comfort to your selves or your friends, of your Justification; not by Faith onely, that is, not by the Faith which is alone, and so a dead Faith is not the true justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith; and the use of all this is to discover the vaine presumption of <hi>Solifidians,</hi> and that Christians may be found in the faith.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, this Proposition is true, <hi>Man is justified onely by faith in Christ Jesus,</hi> that is S. <hi>Pauls</hi> proposition, and St. <hi>James</hi> never denied it: And this Proposition is true, <hi>Man is not justified by Faith, which is alone,</hi> and this is it which St. <hi>James</hi> affirms, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> never denied it, ver. 17. <hi>Even so Faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.</hi> It does not follow then, in S. <hi>James</hi> his opinion, that a man is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied both by works and by faith, because he stands for a faith, that worketh by love: we presse obedience of Faith, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the concurrence of Obedience with Faith, to make us just before God. And this meaning is pointed out to us, ver 14. where the Apostle speaks of the <hi>having of faith with works,</hi> but not of justifying by works with faith. Thus I have, at length, dispatched the Answer to that grand Argument ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of St. <hi>James.</hi> The second is like it, cast in the same Mould, taken out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and therefore it will receive the same Answer. It is thus formed;</p>
                  <p>He that affirmes <hi>Abraham</hi> to be justified by that faith,<note place="margin">2. Argument out of Rom 4:18, 22.</note> which however it was tried, did answer God in actions of faith, doth not exclude actions of faith from faith, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of our Justification, but absolutely requires them as the onely things by which (as by a condition) the man is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified: But St. <hi>Paul</hi> affirmes <hi>Abraham</hi> to be justified by that faith, which however it was tried, did answer God in actions of Faith; therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> does not exclude faithful actions from faith, or the condition of our justification, but absolutely require them, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I distinguish and deny the Major. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> He that affirms <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to be justified by that faith, which being tried, did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer God in actions of Faith, doth not exclude actions of faith (that is) from faith it self, or from the Nature of faith, yet he doth exclude them from the Office of faith, and from
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:205094:184"/>fellowship in justifying (as hath been often said:) Faith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone justifies us relatively, as possessing us of the Object Christ Jesus: but faith with all its Actions, and Habits, and Constellation of Graces, considered as a condition or work, cannot justifie a man before God.</p>
                  <p>As for the Minor, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>
                     </label> it is endeavoured to be proved by two places of Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 20, 22. <hi>who against Hope believed in Hope,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>therefore it was imputed to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse:</hi> for all which acts of faith he was justified, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8, 9, 10. <hi>By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place, which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed,</hi> &amp;c. These are Acts of faith, in all kinds of triall, by which he was, and without which he should not be justified.</p>
                  <p>It is confessed, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified by such a faith, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Answ. </seg>
                     </label> as did answer God in all Trialls,<note place="margin">Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Faith.</note> but not in vertue of those Trials: These were Acts of faith; but we deny, that for them <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified; neither does any thing in the Text countenance such an Assertion.</p>
                  <p>For, first, <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15 6. before any of those Acts mentioned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.18, 20. were performed, which follow after in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.16, 17. and do peculiarly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect the birth of <hi>Isaac.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, And whereas the word (<hi>therefore it was impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> &amp;c.) may seem to imply some excellency and vertue in the very act of his faith, wherefore it was imputed for righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse: I demand whether it were imputed in respect that he believed, or in respect that he believ'd in this full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? if in respect of his measure, then it will follow, that onely such a measure of Faith sufficeth to Justification, which would exclude the Apostles, and many thousands of true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers from Justification; and I think none dare affirme it. But if faith simply in what measure soever, then it affords us this comfortable Doctrine, (namely) that we putting our trust in God for righteousnesse, (giving credit to the truth of his Promise) of blessednesse in the promised Seed, for this was the substance of <hi>Abrahams</hi> saith, I shall have a Seed,<note place="margin">Gen. 22.18.</note> in whom all Nations, and my self also, shall be blessed; for
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:205094:185"/>God at that time preached the Gospel to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gal. 3.8. are accepted and blessed in that beloved one. And lest any should say, What is this to us? The Apostle tells us, v. 23.24. that <hi>it was not written for his sake alone,</hi> as matter of his glory and priviledge, <hi>but for us also,</hi> for our profit and comfort, <hi>to whom it shall be imputed;</hi> yea, if we believe such strange pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises; Nay, but <hi>if we believe on him that raised up Jesus from the dead, who died for our Sins, and rose again for our Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification:</hi> This is the proper and only subject of faith justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, and this it which is imputed to us for righteousnesse. As for that place <hi>Hebr.</hi> cap. 11.8, 9. he speaks of the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of faith, what it will make a Christian do, not of Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have finished the third part of my Conclusion (namely) faithful Actions are not the onely things by which a man is justified: First, not as Causes. Secondly, not as our Evangelicall Righteousnesse. Thirdly, not as meanes of applying Christs Righteousnesse. Fourthly, nor as conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons properly: where is shewed, what we hold, and what we deny touching conditions and qualifications, particularly two Questions are resolved. First, Whether the addition of the word <hi>[as by a Condition]</hi> be a fit <hi>salvo</hi> for those words <hi>[the onely things by which,</hi> &amp;c.] Secondly, Whether they be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed an Antecedent condition to Justification? Denied. The first Reason is from the nature of the Covenant of Grace: The second Reason is, because they are Gifts and Promises of the New Covenant. The third Reason is from the nature of Faith and Repentance. The fourth Reason is from the order of Faith and Works, with an Answer to two grand Arguments, one out of St. <hi>James,</hi> the other out of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for the concurrence of faithfull Actions, with Faith to our Justification.</p>

                     </label> From the Doctrine laid down I reject as erroneous,<note place="margin">Syn <hi>Dort,</hi> &amp;c.</note> the opinion of those, who Teach. First, <hi>Fidem non esse Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num morte Christi partum nec novi foederis promissum, sed ejus conditionem, quae libere ab homine ex se praestetur,</hi> that is, that Faith is not a Gift purchased by Christs Death, nor a Promise of the new Covenant, but a condition which we must
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:205094:185"/>bring on our parts. Secondly, that God chose <hi>Actum fidei loco impletionis totius legis,</hi> the Act of Faith instead of the legall Righteousnesse. Thirdly,<note place="margin">Pract. Cat. Edit. p. 41.42.</note> that without the addition of Workes, any other Act, or Part, or Notion of Faith, would be unsufficient to Justification, and that it is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of Faith by Charity, and good Works, that God accepteth in Christ to Justification; Fourthly, of them that Teach, that Faith is not an Instrument, but onely a condition of Justification, and so hath no other Room in our Justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than Charity, or other Vertues; all which are a part of that Condition, without which, pardon shall not belong to me. Fifthly, that think that we are justified by Obedience, as truly as we are by Faith; so making Obedience the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the covenant of Justification. Sixthly, that Faith receives the Pardon, but doth not thereby justifie: To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Forgivenesse is an Act of Faith, but it does not justifie by so doing.</p>
